# The Reliable Mr. Wilson

Cormac had finished his meal and sat waiting for Mr. Wilson to awake for several minutes. He was just about to start doing some more research on the impostor, when he saw the small man stir. The boy sat back down in his chair and stared down intently at the small man in the bed. Mr. Wilson looked around the room blearily, rubbing the back of his head where his assailant had presumably hit him. He looked over at Cormac and the boy could see a look of fear and surprise in his eyes. "Don't worry", Cormac assured him in the most soothing voice he could muster, "whoever was attacking you is gone now".

The small man bolted upright and reached to his side for his gun, it wasn't there. "Oh, yeah, I put that over in the kitchen, I didn't want you to be uncomfortable while you slept", the boy continued. Mr. Wilson quickly realized that there was no way he was going to be able to get away from the boy, so his only option was diplomacy. He wasn't sure what assailant he had been talking about, the small man had been trying to flee the safe house through the bathroom window, when the door came flying open and smacked him in the back of the head. "Thank you", said the small man, trying to buy himself some time. The boy didn't look immediately threatening or angry, so perhaps he didn't know what he had done. But if not for revenge, what was he doing here?

"What are you doing here? How did you know I was here?", Wilson asked the boy, trying to mask his unease at the whole situation. Had The Condor given Cormac his location? How had he even known what safe house he would be at? He looked up at the boy, waiting for his response, but he was looking around the room nervously. "Wait right there for a moment", the boy said as he stood up and made his way over to the control panel on the wall near the entryway. He peered at it for a moment, looking for the right button, and finally picked one.

The door locked, and the shutters on the windows locked down. Wilson wondered if the boy was activating the mainframe as the overhead lights turned off, only to be replaced by a glowing red bulb. Unlike when the mainframe was usually activated, the floor did not open up, but a metal mesh descended down along the walls of the room, and created a mesh tent around the main area of the room. The room was now a Faraday cage, no communication could go in or out.

In the dim light, Mr. Wilson could see the silhouette of the boy walking back towards him. He couldn't help it, but his heart rate once again increased. The boy didn't look angry, but he was very intense, and gave Wilson a bad vibe. Cormac sat back down in the chair next to the bed and, content with the safety of the room, leaned in to the man and whispered: "There's something corrupt going on inside of The Spy Agency". The boy stared at Mr. Wilson, waiting for the effect of his words to sink in, the small man looked nonplussed. "What are you talking about?", the small man asked warily. The boy explained, "someone is messing with the TSA database. Someone replaced my mother with an impostor, and expected me not to notice. I believe that the same person faked the records in the TSA database to say that she is alive".

The boy's eyes bulged wildly as he finished his explanation in a single breath. He looked at Mr. Wilson expectantly, waiting for some reaction from the man. He saw a look of surprise cross the small man's face, and recoil in what seemed to be horror. "Who could do such a thing?", he asked the boy as he mentally thanked his lucky star that the boy didn't seem to suspect him of anything. VN had some interesting effects. Somehow, it seemed that the boy was trusting Mr. Wilson. Cormac continued, "it would have to be someone high up. There are audits of the database at the higher levels, isn't there?" "Yes, someone high up would have to have done that", the small man agreed, "but which of the high level agents would want to do that to you? Unless..."

"Unless what?", Cormac pleaded with him, and the small man was glad to see that the boy had taken the bait, now he would need to throw the bait far away from him, onto someone the boy could believe had done this. "Well, think about it, if it had to be a high level agent, who would have any reason to want to do something like this to you. Most of the agents in TSA only know of you as the son of the great Holden Anderson.", Mr. Wilson started to explain, "Do you remember when you failed the TSA aptitude test back in your father's study?" "Yes, but that was almost a year ago now, what does that have to do with this?" "Well, you're father was watching you take the test." "And?", Cormac pressed. "It humiliated him. The man had talked for years about how his son was going to grow up to be the next 'Condor' Anderson, and when you failed that test, nobody could let him live it down."

Cormac thought about this. Perhaps his suspicions about not telling his father about the database were well placed. The boy could find no logical fault in the small man's reasoning, and the more he thought about it, the more it made sense. If someone killed his mother, he would also be killing Holden's wife, and if they were trying to cover that up, he was sure that his father would've figured it out. He was also the most highly ranked and decorated agent in the field, so nobody would question any modifications he made to the database. "Yes", said Cormac finally, "that does make sense". A slight smile crossed the face of Mr. Wilson and he leaned in towards the boy, "you can't let anyone else know about this. Anyone in the organization could be in on it, and we don't know who to trust." The boy nodded. "Great, now you should head back home so as to not arise any suspicion, once I am done with my current mission, I will call on you and we can start planning what to do about this".

Cormac didn't really want to wait, but Mr. Wilson did have a point, he would need help if he was going to take down his father. He would definitely need to do some research, and prepare. He agreed to the small man's request, and thanked him. He didn't want to interrupt the man further while he was on his mission, so he let himself out. He would need to go to another safe house until the following day before he could fly back to Vermont. He could hear the rhythmic, almost musical sounds of metal on metal as he walked out of the garage and onto the street. He had parked a half a block down, and so he started off in that direction. As he approached his car, he saw a man in a plain black suit, with a white shirt, and a black tie, leaning against his car. The man didn't seem to care as he watched Cormac approach and reach to unlock the car.

"Can I help you?", the boy asked. The man didn't say anything, but he did stand up to allow Cormac into the car. The boy nervously started to open the door to get inside, he wasn't sure who this man was, but he certainly couldn't trust him. "Who are you?", he continued, hoping the stoic stranger would respond to at least this. "You may call me Mr. Tripp", he said at last, and followed immediately with, "we need to talk Mr. Anderson, I have information that you may find... Useful". Cormac decided that it would be safer to have this conversation in the car, most of the company cars were equipped with a passenger seat that ejected, so he would be able to deal with the man if he became trouble. He gestured to the large man to enter the passenger side, and he acquiesced.

Cormac entered the drivers seat, and rolled up the windows. "What is it that I so desperately need to know", Cormac finally prompted after several minutes of strained silence. "Start driving and I will tell you", said Mr. Tripp enigmatically. Reluctantly, the boy sighed and started the car. If this guy wanted to be ejected from a moving car, that was on him. The engine roared to life, and he started driving. He didn't know the area or the roads, so he drove aimlessly. It was several minutes later, just as Cormac started to become impatient, that the large man finally spoke.

"Mr. Wilson", he began, "I have a proposition for you that we may find to be mutually beneficial. We have been aware for many years that an espionage organization has been running inside the United States under the name of 'The Spy Agency'. For the most part, this group has been relatively harmless. They even sometimes save us the trouble of dealing with some targets ourselves. Nevertheless, an organization such as this has, due to it's growing power and influence in the world stage, become a problem. We have made attempts in the past to deal with this group, but they were unsuccessful. All of our previous attempts had relied on having people on the inside, and so far they have all been rather... Unreliable. Do you understand what I mean?" Cormac nodded silently. Did this man know that he was a TSA agent? The boy considered ejecting the man right there, but then he thought about it. If TSA was really as corrupt as Mr. Wilson had been suggesting, then maybe this man had a point. Maybe Cormac could finally be that man on the inside that didn't betray them.

The man waited for a few moments before continuing. "That... Is where you come in. It has recently come to our attention that you have been recently recruited into this very organization. We also have reason to believe that you have reasons to dislike the organization for which you have found yourself employed. To put it bluntly, Mr. Anderson, we know about what has happened with your mother, and we believe that you will be able to help us deal with our TSA problem while finding those responsible." Cormac continued driving, considering this possibility. He didn't even know who this man was, but somehow he had learned about his mother, and that he was a member of the TSA. That kind of power could be useful if he was going to have to take down the entire organization. The boy wanted to stall for more time, so he asked "what would you need me to do?"

"What we need you to do would not be much different than what we suspect you are already planning to do. Most organizations like this are rather fragile affairs. Sure they seem strong from the outside, but once you get a look at the inside, there are only a few key players holding the whole thing together. From what our sources have told us, TSA has three such pillars. The first we know very little about, as far as we know he is the highest ranked individual in the group, and the agents under him call him 'Die Faust'". Cormac had heard of this man, he was indeed the head of TSA. His name, Cormac had learned from Mr. Wilson, meant "The Fist" after his legendary ability to dissuade dissonance. "The second", the large man continued, "is a man by the name of Stephen Greene. We have reason to suspect that he is in control of the financials of the organization, every piece of money that the group takes in, ends up going through him." The name was not familiar to Cormac, but he wasn't surprised. He had really only learned about other current and former field agents, so finance never came up.

"The third man", Mr. Tripp said, suddenly grim, "is a man by the name of Holden 'Condor' Anderson." Cormac looked at him for a moment, taking his eyes off the road. He saw the grey eyes looking directly at him, unflinching as he finally added, "you are going to need to kill these men".
