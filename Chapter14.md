# Bachelorhood

Cormac carefully peeled the duct tape away from the wall that it had been bonded to for the last year. The strings of adhesive pulled with all their might to hold the plastic bag onto the wall, but ultimately could not hold. Grey residue was left on the wall in regular rectangles everywhere there had been a piece of tape. The bag fell down as the last of the tape holding the top of it was released, it flopped over and fell on top of Cormac's head. He was half way through removing it from his head when he heard footsteps outside his door, and heard a women's voice say "Hello? Is anyone there?". The boy was taken aback by how familiar the voice sounded, he stood there and berated himself for not picking up a gun from one of the stash points along his trip home. His hand-to-hand combat training would have to suffice. He slid out from under the plastic bag, and moved silently to the door. He saw the door handle rattle, and he steadied himself, he was positioned such that the opening door would obscure him, and give him a chance to get a look at the trespasser.

Into the room strode a woman, roughly eight inches shorter than Cormac, looking left and right. She was carrying a baseball bat, and attempting to walk quietly. Like a flash the boy leaped forward, grabbed the bat, and pinned the women to to the ground. She yelped out in surprise, as Cormac's hand pressed into her back, and her body met the floor. The boy held the baseball bat in one hand, and held her pinned down with the other. "Who are you", he growled angrily, "what are you doing in my house?" The woman squirmed under him forcing him to press down harder. "How did you get in here?" he asked again. She began gasping for air, so he let up enough to let her breathe, but not enough to let her get away. "I will ask you one more time. What are you doing here?". "I...", she gasped, "this...", she continued, "this is my house!" she finally finished, her voice filled with indigence.

"Your house? I have lived in this house my entire life, don't tell me it's your house", the younger Anderson accused as he flipped her over onto her back so he could get a look at her. He would want to make sure he could remember the face in case she ever tried to get in again. Cormac began to speak again, but something in the woman's face stopped him. She looked at him with shock, mixed with dawning comprehension, her mouth hanging open wide. She breathed, so quietly that he barely heard her, "Cormac? Is that you?" "How do you know my name, woman", Cormac roared, "are you the one that stole my MacGuffin?" Her eyes started to water as she looked up at him. He sat upwards, still holding her down with his legs, but no longer with his arms. She had stopped struggling. "Don't you recognize me, son?", she asked him finally. Cormac just sat there staring at her.

He couldn't shake how familiar she looked, it hurt how much he felt like he should recognize her, but how could he be her son? His mother was... Was... Now that he thought about it, he couldn't even remember having a mother. But then, who had he been living with? He knew that he had lived in this house his entire life, he also knew that his father had left years ago. He was sure he had been living with someone before he...

Cormac slumped sideways, releasing the woman from underneath him. Images that he had tried so hard to forget came rushing back. He remembered seeing the body of his mother spread out on her bed, bruises around her neck, her face bloodied. He remembered the pool of blood that had spread around her, and he could remember standing in the room for hours crying and vomiting. All these memories came flooding back to him, before he realized. The woman, the woman in his bedroom, the one that had seemed so familiar. Was the same woman that he had found bleeding on the bed downstairs. He moved across the room, and sat down on his bed. He stared at her. She looked exactly like her. "how..." he started, "how could you be my...". "Your mother", she finished. "But how? You... I saw..." he stopped himself. If his mother was truly dead, and he had such a hard time remembering it, then this woman might not really be his mother at all. She may be another spy trying to destroy the son of the great "Condor" Anderson.

Rage boiled inside the pit of his stomach, but he let none of that show on his face. If this person was indeed an impostor, he wasn't about to let her know. "Mom?" he said, feigning comprehension. Her face brightened, and she took a step towards him. He closed the gap in no time, and hugged the woman, using it as an opportunity to check her for more weapons or even a wire. "You're finally home", she said through sobs, "where have you been? The police searched everywhere, and nobody could find any trace of you. Your work called day after day, but no one heard from you." "I was training", Cormac replied, not wanting to betray too much information. "Training? Where? When you collapsed on the sidewalk, I was so worried about you", she choked through continued crying, "I was jogging around the neighborhood when I found you on the concrete. The took you to the hospital over night. I was waiting outside your room the whole time, but somehow you vanished. The doctors didn't know what happened." "Well I'm back now", he reassured her.

There was a pause where neither party seemed like they had anything to say. Cormac broke the silence, "you mentioned my job, I take it Mr. Stern has fired me?". "Mr. Stern?" his mother replied, confused, "You never worked for a Mr. Stern, Gene Coleman was your boss at MCI. He called several times after you went missing. He was very understanding, said if you ever do turn up, that you'd always have a job." 'She didn't take the bait', Cormac said to himself, 'this woman has done her homework. Still, she'll slip up someday, and when that day comes, I will be ready to take her down'. "Well that's good to hear", he replied without missing a beat, "I'll have to make my way back over to MCI soon to talk to Mr. Coleman about getting my job back." His "mom" sniffed as her crying began to slow. "I'm just glad you're home", she told him.

The woman that Cormac now realized would be living with him from now on, looked at him with a soft expression, tears in her eyes. "I'll let you get settled in, have you eaten?" she asked as she walked out the door. He replied with a slight nod, "Yes, I ate on the way over here". If this woman was here for... Whatever she was here for, he wouldn't put it past her to poison him. He would have to wait until the following day to get some food. Not much of a trouble for him, he went several weeks without food during his training as an exercise, so he was adept at dealing with a little bit of hunger pain. He waited in the middle of the room for the sound of the impostor to fade, before he laid down in his bed. This, at least, was familiar to him. He fell asleep almost immediately, months of training had drilled into him the need to sleep at a moment's notice whenever the opportunity arose. However, he kept one eye open looking at the door. He wasn't about to sleep soundly in this house while that woman was there.

The next morning, the boy was happy to see that the night had passed uneventfully, and the woman hadn't bothered him once. He could smell bacon and eggs as he walked down the stairs to his kitchen. He was still wearing the same suit he had on the previous night, he would need to pick up more while he was out. There was a safe house a couple blocks from his house that should have some selection, although it might be specialized for Mr. Wilson after he had stayed in the area for so long. The strange woman, looking so much like his mother, was painful to look at this morning. She was even cooking breakfast in the exact same way that his real mother used to. He couldn't afford to risk eating her food however, so he feigned being late for something, and headed out the door. He heard her protest as he shut the door behind him, but he didn't stop to respond.
