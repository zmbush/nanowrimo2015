# Desperate times

"What do you mean you haven't started training him yet?" an irate agent Anderson cried out "You were supposed to get started 2 months ago!" The diminutive face of Earl Wilson was blown up to two feet tall on the screen in front of Holden. The small man squirmed uncomfortably as he replied "He is being... Difficult" and couldn't help but betray a small flinch. "He's being difficult? Difficult!? He's a fucking Anderson for Christ's sake. He's going to do this job and he's going to like it!" his face started to go slightly red as he screamed at Mr. Wilson. "I'll see what I can do" responded the midget quietly. "You'd better!", raged Holden, "Or I'll make you even less of a man than you already are." The screen went black as The Condor slammed his hand down onto the hang up button.

Holden had been undercover for the last 3 months dismantling a south Australian drug ring, and had expected to come back to find his son well on the way to following in his illustrious footsteps. After all, he had done so much to pave the way for his son to reach his full potential, and he wasn't about to let Wilson ruin that by giving up on him. That little shit had given him his word that he would train Cormac, and now he's trying to get out of it because his son is being "difficult"? This would not stand. He only had a few days to get prepped for his next assignment, so he was unable to deal with the matter personally, but he expected that the midget would get through to Cormac. Nothing he ever said seemed to get through to him, but Holden knew that sons never listen to their fathers.

Agent Anderson left the small conference room and headed down the hallway to his office. The order of the place never failed to bring him back to center. His desk was placed exactly in the center of the rather spacious room. Directly behind his chair was the window, shades drawn. The floor was khaki and never showed a single scuff or stain. Upon his desk lay a single basket of papers marked "IN", and next to the wall to the right of his desk was a row of filing cabinets. Not a single thing was out of place. He sat down in his desk for a brief moment, and looked over at his "IN" basket. It was empty. Holden breathed a sigh and stared for a moment at the door of his office where he could make out "Anderson" written backwards on the translucent glass. For a moment he forgot that his son was continuing to be a disappointment to him.

The screaming face of Holden Anderson was burned into Mr. Wilson's retinas as the screen of his laptop suddenly went black. "Shit" he said under his breath. The Condor was not someone he wanted to cross, that was why he agreed to help his son in the first place. It never occurred to him that Cormac was going to be such a pain in his ass. Nothing he had done in the last few months had done anything to convince the youth to start training. In fact, whenever Cormac spotted him, he would usually sprint in the opposite direction. Hell, the kid wouldn't even acknowledge that his father was even *alive* let alone a super-spy whose footsteps he was supposed to follow.

The apartment Earl had been staying in for the past several months was, in no uncertain terms, a shit hole. The cold winter rain would drip through cracks in the ceiling, and there was what appeared to be a bubble of paint on one of the walls that would slowly move down the wall as the water poured down. Not expecting to be living there for very long, Mr. Wilson hadn't even bothered to get much of the basic necessities. When he had moved in, there was a mattress that had appeared to be the home to a small society of bed bugs, and the refrigerator, which had been turned off for who knows how long, was filled with the foulest smell he had ever experienced.

Empty takeout containers littered the floor around the small tiled area of the apartment that was supposed to be the "kitchen". The only things in the room that betrayed Earl's true purpose was the equipment that he had set up near the only usable window. He had a camera set up on a tripod with a telephoto lens attached, he had his computer with known routes that Cormac frequented, and had his notepad on which he had been writing down and subsequently scratching off all of the ways he had been trying to convince the youth to just accept his training and move on with his life. Countless times over the last few months, Earl had considered just giving up and heading back to the agency, but he knew that the wrath of The Condor knew no bounds. He had heard that the last agent who crossed him ended up being discharged with schizophrenia a mere two weeks later.

Earl looked out the window and saw that Cormac was heading out the front door to head to work. Mr. Wilson donned his black winter jacket and balaclava and headed out to follow him. The boy noticed him almost immediately. "At least", thought Earl, "he's learning to detect someone following him". Though He wasn't sure if his target was getting better at detecting him, or if he had just come to expect that the small man would follow him out into the snow. "Cormac!" he called out. The boy merely sped up. "CORMAC!" he tried again in vain. The boy took off again at a full out sprint. "At least he seems to be getting in better shape" Mr. Wilson tried to console himself as he started to match his pace. The memory of The Condor's bright red screaming face gave Earl an unusual burst of adrenaline, and he found himself within reaching distance of the boy.

Mr. Wilson leaped forward and grabbed hard onto Cormac's back leg and they both went down onto the icy sidewalk together. Earl, padded by Cormac's leg was none the worse for wear, but the boy, as he now saw, had received a face full of concrete. Blood was running from his nose and was dripping from a gash in his chin, he looked at the small man with eyes so reminiscent of his fathers that Mr. Wilson recoiled involuntarily. "What" said Cormac curtly as he wiped blood away from his mouth. The blood from his chin had already dripped down and stained his shirt and his face carried that same mad dog expression that his father's displayed when angry.

Panting from the effort of keeping up with Cormac, Mr. Wilson took several moments to respond. "You need to let me train you", he said for the umpteenth time, "Your father is going to kill me if I don't train you". "That sounds like your problem", the youth said with a voice that sounded like he was getting over a cold. "After he left me and my mother, I don't owe that man anything, and I owe you even less". Cormac got to his feet, wiping blood onto the sleeve of his coat, and started to walk away. Mr. Wilson couldn't think of any way to respond to that, and so he let the boy go.

Once Mr. Wilson could no longer see Cormac, he pulled himself up off the cold ground and sat down on a nearby bus stop. He sat there for at least an hour mulling over his options. Nothing he was doing seemed to, in any way, encourage the younger Anderson to accept his training. He had been trying for months and all he saw was a lazy entitled shit going about his mundane life, and somehow being happy about it! It seemed that nothing Earl could do would change his mind. Nothing He could do. Mr. Wilson couldn't help but smile as he finally realized how he would help Cormac realize his true destiny. And this time, it was sure to work.
