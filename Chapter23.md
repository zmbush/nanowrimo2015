# Gentle Encouragement

Earl Wilson was dropped off in front of the TSA headquarters at a quarter past twelve. He had taken a taxi directly from the airport, and he was desperate to get back to his office so he could file his report and go home. The elevator took him up to the eighteenth floor as quickly as he had remembered it. Mr. Wilson wasn't sure how much of his son's condition he was aware of. The boy was becoming dangerous, but then again, so was his father. As the elevator doors opened, the small man breathed a sigh of relief when he remembered that he was on the floor below Holden and he wouldn't have to walk past the man's office.

He couldn't help but hope that Cormac would follow through on what he was sure had become his plan. If Holden was killed, he would be next in line to move up to the 19th floor. If Holden was killed, he wouldn't have to face the music when the man discovered what exactly the VN had done to his son. He just had to make sure that nobody could tie him to the crime. So far, nobody except Cormac's father was aware that the boy was even looking for him, and nobody to date had seen him together. Once he was done at the office, he would have to head over to Vermont to talk with the boy to explain that they could never be seen together lest somebody suspects something.

Mr. Wilson wasn't one who was often surprised. He thought through a lot of scenarios, and more often than not, he thought of an outcome before it happened. The events with Holden, while terrifying, were not altogether unexpected. Cormac's descent into what could only be described as VN madness, had been considered. But for some reason, when Earl Wilson opened the door to his office at TSA headquarters, he had not even considered that what he would see when he opened the door, was the very person he most did not want to be in his office.

"Hey", came a voice out of the ether, slightly rousing Cormac from his unintentional slumber. He started to blink blearily when he felt a smooth solid object collide with his head. His eyes opened just enough to see the silhouette of a small person standing on top of the desk in front of him, as the world slowly tilted sideways until he hit the floor with a thud. Out in the distance he could hear what he assumed was the small man yelling at him, "what are you doing here?" But the world around him slowly faded and so did the voice of the small man.

When Cormac awoke again, he found himself in a familiar room, not unlike the one back in Vermont that he had spent so many days in. In fact, upon closer inspection, it was the exact same room. He was lying in the bed in the corner of the room, and as he looked across the room, he could see the small man sitting a few feet away from him, looking off in another direction. When the boy tried to sit, up, the small man's attention snapped to him, and frowned. "What the hell were you doing breaking into my office?", he roared at the boy, standing up on top of his chair. "Do you know what would happen if somebody found you there? You should be glad that it was me who found you and not somebody else". Cormac cocked his head to one side and looked at the small man, confused.

"You were done with your mission", he said blearily, "I needed to see you, to talk about our plan". The small man looked at him, still filled with rage, "even so, you can't just come barging into my office! You need to be discrete about things like this. And anyway, what were we going to do, there are cameras all over in that area, we wouldn't be able to have a private chat even if we wanted to". Cormac looked at the ground, how was he going to get revenge for what happened to his mother if he couldn't talk to the one person in the world he could trust. "I needed information, I was trying to get information about Sandra Wilkinson and Stephen Greene so I could figure out how to take them down too".

The small man looked at Cormac with a very concerned look on his face, "What do you plan to do to Mrs. Wilkinson and Mr. Greene? They have never done anything to you". Cormac leaned in close and tried to explain. He told Mr. Wilson about Mr. Tripp, how he had told Cormac that his organization was investigating TSA. He told Mr. Wilson that these two along with his father were responsible for what had happened to him, what had happened to his mother. Mr. Wilson looked very concerned, "where did you meet this Mr. Tripp, Cormac? Are you sure he can be trusted?", the small man looked him dead in the eyes, "I thought we had decided that your father was the cause of your problems."

"No, but Wilkinson and Greene were also high ranking enough to cover up what really happened to my mom", the boy looked at the man, pleading to be taken at his word, "Mr. Tripp had a lot of information, he was from a very powerful organization. He must have been. I trusted him". Mr. Wilson just continued trying to convince the boy that his real focus should be on his father, that his father was the real problem. The boy continued getting more and more agitated as the small man continued to deny that he had a point. Nothing the boy could say could convince the man.

Finally, after arguing for at least half an hour, the man suggested that some food might calm his nerves, and help him to think more rationally about what was going on. They sat down on the table, and Mr. Wilson produced a large meal on a tray, complete with same meat, some mashed potatoes, green beans, and a juice. Also, the tray contained a small plate with a brownie on it. Upon seeing the food, Cormac realized just how hungry he was, he wasn't sure when he had last eaten. He was sure that he had eaten before entering TSA headquarters, but he couldn't figure out how long ago that was. Somehow he had been taken back to the safe house in the mean time.

Cormac sat there and felt his body relax as he finished off the main dish and the juice that accompanied it. Mr. Wilson sat across from him and watched him eat, observing him carefully and occasionally typing something into his phone. When the boy had finished the main food, Mr. Wilson started talking to him again, pointedly asking him about his father, and what he had done. He tried to convince the boy that Mrs. Wilkinson, and Mr. Greene were not his real targets, and in his state of food coma, Cormac was inclined to agree with him. Every time he really thought about it, he could only really come up with reasons why his father was the one to blame, not the other two. Mr. Tripp had just seemed so... Convincing.

Cormac finally agreed with Mr. Wilson that he would need to deal only with his father, and that he would no longer focus on the other two. In a strange way, this was a relief to the boy, as he now only had one thing to focus on. Once their conversation had drawn to a close, Cormac grabbed the brownie and started eating it. His rest that he had just awoken from must have not been particularity restful, and the boy came to the realization that he really needed to sleep again. He laid down on the bed in the corner, and as he drifted off to sleep, he saw Mr. Wilson leaving through through the front door.
