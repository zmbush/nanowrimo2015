# Gentle Encouragement

Earl Wilson was dropped off in front of the TSA headquarters at a quarter past twelve. He had taken a taxi directly from the airport, and he was desperate to get back to his office so he could file his report and go home. The elevator took him up to the eighteenth floor as quickly as he had remembered it. Mr. Wilson wasn't sure how much of his son's condition he was aware of. The boy was becoming dangerous, but then again, so was his father. As the elevator doors opened, the small man breathed a sigh of relief when he remembered that he was on the floor below Holden and he wouldn't have to walk past the man's office.

He couldn't help but hope that Cormac would follow through on what he was sure had become his plan. If Holden was killed, he would be next in line to move up to the 19th floor. If Holden was killed, he wouldn't have to face the music when the man discovered what exactly the VN had done to his son. He just had to make sure that nobody could tie him to the crime. So far, nobody except Cormac's father was aware that the boy was even looking for him, and nobody to date had seen him together. Once he was done at the office, he would have to head over to Vermont to talk with the boy to explain that they could never be seen together lest somebody suspects something.

Mr. Wilson wasn't one who was often surprised. He thought through a lot of scenarios, and more often than not, he thought of an outcome before it happened. The events with Holden, while terrifying, were not altogether unexpected. Cormac's descent into what could only be described as VN madness, had been considered. But for some reason, when Earl Wilson opened the door to his office at TSA headquarters, he had not even considered that what he would see when he opened the door, was the very person he most did not want to be in his office.

"Hey", came a voice out of the ether, slightly rousing Cormac from his unintentional slumber. He started to blink blearily when he felt a smooth solid object collide with his head. His eyes opened just enough to see the silhouette of a small person standing on top of the desk in front of him, as the world slowly tilted sideways until he hit the floor with a thud. Out in the distance he could hear what he assumed was the small man yelling at him, "what are you doing here?" But the world around him slowly faded and so did the voice of the small man.

* * *

When Cormac awoke again, he found himself in a familiar room, not unlike the one back in Vermont that he had spent so many days in. In fact, upon closer inspection, it was the exact same room. He was lying in the bed in the corner of the room, and as he looked across the room, he could see the small man sitting a few feet away from him, looking off in another direction. When the boy tried to sit, up, the small man's attention snapped to him, and frowned. "What the hell were you doing breaking into my office?", he roared at the boy, standing up on top of his chair. "Do you know what would happen if somebody found you there? You should be glad that it was me who found you and not somebody else". Cormac cocked his head to one side and looked at the small man, confused.

"You were done with your mission", he said blearily, "I needed to see you, to talk about our plan". The small man looked at him, still filled with rage, "even so, you can't just come barging into my office! You need to be discrete about things like this. And anyway, what were we going to do, there are cameras all over in that area, we wouldn't be able to have a private chat even if we wanted to". Cormac looked at the ground, how was he going to get revenge for what happened to his mother if he couldn't talk to the one person in the world he could trust. "I needed information, I was trying to get information about Sandra Wilkinson and Stephen Greene so I could figure out how to take them down too".

The small man looked at Cormac with a very concerned look on his face, "What do you plan to do to Mrs. Wilkinson and Mr. Greene? They have never done anything to you". Cormac leaned in close and tried to explain. He told Mr. Wilson about Mr. Tripp, how he had told Cormac that his organization was investigating TSA. He told Mr. Wilson that these two along with his father were responsible for what had happened to him, what had happened to his mother. Mr. Wilson looked very concerned, "where did you meet this Mr. Tripp, Cormac? Are you sure he can be trusted?", the small man looked him dead in the eyes, "I thought we had decided that your father was the cause of your problems."

"No, but Wilkinson and Greene were also high ranking enough to cover up what really happened to my mom", the boy looked at the man, pleading to be taken at his word, "Mr. Tripp had a lot of information, he was from a very powerful organization. He must have been. I trusted him". Mr. Wilson just continued trying to convince the boy that his real focus should be on his father, that his father was the real problem. The boy continued getting more and more agitated as the small man continued to deny that he had a point. Nothing the boy could say could convince the man.

Finally, after arguing for at least half an hour, the man suggested that some food might calm his nerves, and help him to think more rationally about what was going on. They sat down on the table, and Mr. Wilson produced a large meal on a tray, complete with same meat, some mashed potatoes, green beans, and a juice. Also, the tray contained a small plate with a brownie on it. Upon seeing the food, Cormac realized just how hungry he was, he wasn't sure when he had last eaten. He was sure that he had eaten before entering TSA headquarters, but he couldn't figure out how long ago that was. Somehow he had been taken back to the safe house in the mean time.

Cormac sat there and felt his body relax as he finished off the main dish and the juice that accompanied it. Mr. Wilson sat across from him and watched him eat, observing him carefully and occasionally typing something into his phone. When the boy had finished the main food, Mr. Wilson started talking to him again, pointedly asking him about his father, and what he had done. He tried to convince the boy that Mrs. Wilkinson, and Mr. Greene were not his real targets, and in his state of food coma, Cormac was inclined to agree with him. Every time he really thought about it, he could only really come up with reasons why his father was the one to blame, not the other two. Mr. Tripp had just seemed so... Convincing.

Cormac finally agreed with Mr. Wilson that he would need to deal only with his father, and that he would no longer focus on the other two. In a strange way, this was a relief to the boy, as he now only had one thing to focus on. Once their conversation had drawn to a close, Cormac grabbed the brownie and started eating it. His rest that he had just awoken from must have not been particularity restful, and the boy came to the realization that he really needed to sleep again. He laid down on the bed in the corner, and as he drifted off to sleep, he saw Mr. Wilson leaving through through the front door.

* * *

Cormac awoke what he could only assume was several hours later, and looked around. Mr. Wilson was still not around, and he wasn't sure what he should do now. The small man kept telling him to focus on his father, and to not blame Ms. Wilkinson or Mr. Greene, but he found it difficult to change his focus from what he had been working towards for the past few weeks. He looked up at the clock and realized that he was late for work, so he quickly got himself dressed and headed over to work. The familiar street was calming as he walked towards the building where he had worked for the past 5 years. Ever since his father left.

He walked in, nodding to his boss and a few of his co-workers, none of which acknowledged him. He once again sat down in his familiar chair and did his familiar task. He found that doing data entry was one of the only things he knew of that could calm his mind and make him focus on nothing else. He could sit for hours only focusing on this one task and he would still be able to find a strange amount of joy in the tedium.

Today, however, was different. As he sat and entered the data from form after form, he found his mind wandering. He sat and tried to focus on the task at hand, but he continued to think about what he needed to do. His father was a problem, that much was assured. He had left his mother and him, and he could never forgive him for that. It was because he left that he needed to get a job at Major Corporation Inc. It was because he left that his mother fell apart. And now, he has replaced her with an impostor, he needed to be stopped.

Cormac was certain that he was making mistakes in his data entry. He had made mistakes before, but nobody had ever noticed. There was simply too much data to go through to verify that it was entered correctly. So today, he just made sure that he was entering data as fast as he could, not really caring if he was entering it accurately. He needed to get back to the safe house. He would need to plan his next move. From what he had seen from his last visit, Mr. Wilson wasn't going to be much help. He knew as well as anyone that Holden was a problem, but he couldn't see that Ms. Wilkinson and Mr. Greene needed to be dealt with as well.

As the end of the day neared, the boy's stomach growled as he realized that he had accidentally skipped lunch. Despite this, his mind had been made up. As he placed the last piece of paper on his out pile, he came to a resolution. He would need to move tonight if he was going to have any chance of dealing with the trio that had conspired to murder his mother and replace her with some pale resemblance of a human. Some kind of automaton, that acted like his mother but was certainly not her. He needed revenge.

The walk back to the safe house was uneventful enough. He stopped to get some food on the way home. It was some simple food, but he didn't really care. He was on a mission, and he needed to get back to his safe house as quickly as he could so he could have some peace. This was going to be the night when he made sure that his mother's death was avenged. This was the night when he would prove to his father that he wasn't so much of a disappointment that he needed to leave him and his mother behind. This. Was. The. Night.

It was twilight by the time Cormac made it back to the safe house. He walked in, and immediately pressed the button to lock the room down. He didn't want anyone getting in or out, not while he was planning. The safe houses were accessible by any agent, true, but when one was locked down, not even the most senior agent could get in. It was a failsafe that had been put in to protect agents in the event of a rogue agent targeting them. Cormac would need all the protection he could get.

Cormac sat down at the computer and pulled out from his pocket the thing that would make all of his research possible. He would need it to find out how he could take down his trio of targets. He smiled in a kind of untamed joy as he began to turn the dials to attempt to gain access to Mr. Wilson's mainframe account. He had grabbed the cypher from the man's pocket on the previous night after he had seen it sticking out. He was certain that it would come in handy. The boy also considered himself lucky to have spent so much time with the man, as he had observed the man generate his passwords on multiple occasions, and he knew what Mr. Wilson knew. He knew his password.

At least, He was fairly certain that he knew the small man's password. He tried what he thought was the password, and attempted to dial it in to the small man's cypher. He had no luck, unfortunately. He tried several variations on that password as well, with little success. He was getting frustrated, and he almost smashed the small device on the ground, but he managed to calm himself, when he finally realized that he had always seen the small man use his cypher upside down! When Cormac flipped the password he was trying to enter upside down, he was successfully able to gain access to the account!
