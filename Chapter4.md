# Chapter 4: Paperwork

Cormac spun on his heels to look back at the room, but nothing had changed since the last time he looked at it. He put his hand on the book, and turned to look around the room. He pressed it. Click. It wasn't coming from the door. Click. Not the trophy case either. Click. It seems like it's coming from the desk. Click. Yes, it's got to be the desk.

He walked towards the desk, not sure what to expect. He walked around to the front. Nothing had changed. He looked underneath. Nothing. He tried one of the drawers. It moved! The drawer slid open so smoothly that Cormac barely had to exert any force on it. When it was open far enough for him to look inside, he saw that it appeared to be completely full of paper files. There wasn't anything under the folders either.

The folders all had boring titles like "taxes" and "vehicles", so Cormac tried to open another drawer. This one opened easily as well, and was full of papers and pens, all apparently unused. Finally, he opened the top drawer. Inside he saw a few crumpled pieces of paper, some pens, and a small hole in the bottom of the drawer. He reached underneath the drawer, and could find no hole, so he reaches his hand into the drawer, and feels the bottom of the drawer. It shifts slightly as he touches it.

Cormac takes a deep breath and uses the hole to lift the bottom of the drawer to reveal a small indent. Inside there is a small indent that looks to be about the same size and shape of his MacGuffin, and inside of there, he saw a small silver with a thin chain wrapped around it. As he lifts the key out of the drawer, he hears his mother from upstairs shouting something.

He closes the drawers of the desk and leaves the room to figure out what was going on. He heads upstairs to find his mom angrily cleaning the towel fuzz of the wall in his bathroom.

"Mom, I said I would clean it!"

"Well you didn't. Now I have to."

"Mom, stop. I'll do it."

She left him to it, and went back downstairs. He used the sponge that his mom had left to scrub down the wall until the purple fuzz and blood were nowhere to be seen. He scrubbed the sink to get rid of the caked on blood. He finally scrubbed the floor and the mirrors. By the time he had finished cleaning the room, it looked as good as it had that morning, and it was well after 10 pm.

Making his way downstairs, Cormac smelled the faint remains of whatever his mom had cooked for dinner. He opened the fridge to see if there was any left over. He found a small tub of spaghetti. The microwave beeped several minutes later and hot spaghetti comes out.

He sits in the middle of the kitchen, and slowly eats his dinner. He takes the key out of his pocket and starts to look at it more closely. It didn't look like any key he'd seen before, and he couldn't figure out what it could possibly belong to.

He washes his dishes and returns them to the cabinets. It's completely dark outside, and he has work the next day. He can't afford to call another day out of work, so he needs to head to sleep.
