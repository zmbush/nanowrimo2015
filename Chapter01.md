# Chapter 1: The incident

The fall air comes rushing through Cormac Anderson's open window. Ripples of air play across his face and make it very difficult for him to continue sleeping. Sleeping is one of the few things he enjoy these days.  He think back to last night, and to the endless stream of netflix and popcorn. He can't recall leaving his window open. He never leaves it open this time of year, it always gets too cold at night. Why would He have left it open? He can't remember.

He opens his eyes and begins to stand up to close the window, when his foot begins to experience extreme pain. He jerks his foot back and falls back against the bed. Upon close inspection, he realizes that a rather large chunk of glass has embedded itself in the arch of his foot. By this time his eyes have cleared up enough such that he is able to see the floor of his room, littered with glass and his possessions.

He props himself up against the wall of his bedroom and starts to hop his way towards his bathroom.  He makes it with little incident, and he manages to contort his leg such that his foot is sitting in the sink. He begins to run the water over the wound as he fumbles in the medicine cabinet for some tweezers and bandages. He finds the box of gauze, and places it on the counter. He can't find the tweezers, but decides to pull it out by hand. It's not very deep, but it still hurts like a bitch as he pulls it gingerly out of his foot. The blood starts to flow as the chunk of glass clatters in the bottom of the porcelain basin.

"Shit, where's my towel?".

The wound is bleeding more than he had expected. He fumbles behind him for his towel, but as he leans backwards, his awkward position gives way as his good foot slips and he tumbles down to the cold tile. He cries out in pain as his head slams against the wall and he slumps down. So much for not getting blood everywhere, the red water from the sink splashed everywhere. He reaches up and grabs his towel and wraps his aching foot.

He pulls himself up and turns off the water. He rests gingerly on the toes of his left foot and reaches for the box of gauze to wrap his foot. Empty.

"Mom!?", he shouts to no reply.

After calling several more times and waiting a few minutes, he starts to walk downstairs. The main bathroom always has more bandages. With his foot wrapped in the towel, it doesn't hurt as much, but he still winces every time he steps down. He reaches the bathroom, and finally manages to bandage his foot. He continues to walk on his toes as he pulls himself back upstairs.

During this endeavour, he had given little thought to why there was a piece of glass on his floor.  He also hadn't considered that the glass and his open window might be related, but as he reached his bedroom again, it was obvious. In the center of the room there was a brick, and surrounding it, there were pieces of his window strewn about the room. The papers from his desk were strewn around the room, and his computer monitor was laying on the floor.

At first glance, he couldn't tell if anything was taken. Most of his stuff just seemed to be in disarray. He picked up his cell phone from his bedside table, and checked the time. He put the phone in his pocket before it hit him. 8:45. He had slept through his alarm for the fourth time this month.

"Fuck, I've only got 15 minutes!", he shouts as he starts an adrenaline filled morning routine. The bathroom was still covered in blood, so he skipped brushing his teeth. He was dressed and heading out the door in 5 minutes flat. He picked up his phone, wallet, and watch, and put them in their appropriate places. He then reached down again for his MacGuffin. Gone. Someone had stolen his MacGuffin.
