# Chapter 11: A Short Stay

The boy was only dimly aware of the sound of sirens approaching as his body slowly melted the ice around it. The freezing water had long ago soaked through his jacket and had made piercing contact with his skin. He stared blankly out at the street, his stomach empty, his eyes no longer to produce tears. The lights of the cop cars and ambulances light up the darkening street and seemed to mock Cormac with their almost joyful brightness. The paramedic was at his side trying to get him off of the street, but he struggled wildly gesturing into the house, trying to shout out "Inside" through a large lump in his throat. The man in white lifted Cormac off the ground, and with his body too weak to struggle anymore, the boy started to drift in and out of conciousness. Just before the door to the ambulance closed, Cormac could see the blurry outline of a police officer entering his home, gun drawn. The inside of the ambulance was all too loud as all of the people inside of it shouted out indistinctly. "Ambulance jargon!" one of them shouted out, "Okay" came the reply. They removed his clothes and wrapped his limp body in a blanket. With his body newly warmed, Cormac could no longer stave off his exhaustion, and fell asleep.

The small man was sitting in his squalid apartment at around three in the afternoon. He was happy for the first time in several months, because he had finally figured out how to get the younger Anderson boy to accept his training as his father demanded. He had shown the boy the one thing he could not ignore or just brush off, he had shown the boy his mother, dead, in her own bed. Now it was only a matter of time before the boy was able to put two and two together and realize that, had he been training all this time, he may have been able to save his mother. He will be left with no reasonable choice but to come straight to me to help him never lose another loved one again. He need only wait.

Beep beep. Pause. Beep beep. Pause. Beep beep. The youth awoke to the rhythm of his own beating heart as performed by the hospital equipment. There was a curtain drawn all around him, so all he could see were the ghostly outlines of what he could only assume were nurses and doctors. He could hear the hum of a finely tuned machine going on all around him, and the faint sound of hospital jargon. He laid back in his bed and began to scratch an itch on his arm, only to find that there was a rubbery tube coming out of his arm. He looked over to see a clear liquid in a bag hanging above him. "It's a saline solution" came a voice that Cormac recognized, but he couldn't remember why. The curtain was thrown open, and next to his bed he saw the trench coat and hat that had been tormenting him these last few months. "You had one hell of a fever when they brought you in here." he continued, smiling slightly "but you're looking much better now". Cormac tried to yell at the man, but found that he was still too exhausted.

"You're going to be fine" the small man espoused matter-of-factly. "Now come with me, I've got you discharged and I have a car to take you home downstairs". Cormac opened his mouth to protest, but stopped when the midget added "I can help you find who did that to your mother". The midget started to walk out the door and looked at Cormac expectantly. "I'll explain on the way". Cormac got up hesitantly, still weak from the night before, but was able to stand. He started to walk towards Mr. Wilson until he felt a tug on his right forearm. The small man walked back towards the boy, and removed his IV before leading him out the door and towards the elevator. Six floors later and the doors opened, revealing the front lobby of the central downtown hospital. Cormac stumbled as the midget continued to push him forward, more insistently now, towards the exit. Cormac looked around, confused. He had expected there to be more people. He attempted to turn around to look for someone, but the tiny man, in light of Cormac's weakened state, was stronger than he. The front doors of the hospital slid open, and a black limousine opened its door to let them in. Once inside, he saw the midget push a button on the wall, and the vehicle sped off.

Still weak and dazed after being rushed out of the hospital, Cormac sat in the chair of the limousine silently for what may have been hours. The car simply sped along, turning occasionally, and going... Somewhere. Cormac looked out the window, he didn't recognize where he was anymore, and could barely make out anything in the almost pitch darkness. "How are we going to find them?" Cormac spoke, slurring his words slightly. "Just trust me, young Anderson, we will find out who did this". Cormac felt a slight pain in his side, he figured it was probably from when he fell outside his house. His eyes started to blur again and he could hear Mr. Wilson speaking to him in a voice so muffled that he couldn't make out the words. The boy started to lean over in his seat and close his eyes. He could just barely make out the words "trust me" before he closed his eyes to sleep.

The car was still speeding along in the middle of nowhere when Cormac awoke once more. He pulled himself upright and looked out of the window. He could see gray farmland, the occasional house, and the frequent occurrence of a wooden power pole sticking up from the side of the road. The boy looked around the inside of the car and saw that there was a fast food hamburger, fries, and a soda laid out in front of him. The small man was nowhere to be seen. Cormac couldn't be sure, but this did look like the same limousine he had gotten into. He looked towards the front of the vehicle, but he couldn't see the driver through the black glass window. The boy crawled forward towards the front of the car as the vehicle swayed slightly from side to side. He sat on the seat that was closest to the window and knocked. He waited for several minutes, but he heard no response. He knocked again. No response. His stomach rumbled. How long had it been since he'd eaten?

He moved back towards the back of the car and the food that, he assumed, had been left for him. The French Fries were the most delicious piece of food that he had ever tasted, and the burger was a close second. He inhaled the food so quickly that he hardly had time to breathe, only stopping for the occasional drink from the soda cup. When he finished the food, he sat back down in the chair, content in a way he had not been in months. His eyelids grew heavy again, and he drifted off to sleep.
