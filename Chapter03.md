# Discovery

As Cormac reached the top of the stairs he gazed upon the ransacked mess of his bedroom. His mom had cleaned up the glass, but nothing else. He began to put his room back in order, hoping in vain that his MacGuffin would be somewhere in the room. Once he had made a first pass at cleaning up, he began to realize that he may never get his MacGuffin back.

He then made his way to the bathroom. The sink was still full of red water, and blood was splattered on the walls and mirrors. He drained the sink and started scrubbing the walls with his already bloodstained towel. No longer able to distract himself with work, his anger about the whole situation began bubbling up. Who could have taken it, and why?

The unanswered questions, and the feeling of violation served to fuel Cormac's fervent scrubbing. It wasn't until he took a momentary breather, that he realized that he had been shredding his towel on the rough wall, and it was now covered in purple fuzz. Why would someone want the MacGuffin? In all the years he'd had it, he hadn't really observed it much. Sure, he knew the patterns that were embossed on its surface, but he never thought of it as much more than a trinket to remember his father by.

Unable to think about much else, he found him self hours later pacing around his room trying in vain to come up with some explanation for what had happened. He glanced towards what was once his bedroom window, but was now a 6 foot by 12 foot hole covered by trash bags and duck tape. Cormac walked downstairs to ask his mother if he could look around in his father's old study. Even though it had been several years, neither of us had been able to bring ourselves to enter or even dust inside his study.

After a lengthy discussion, she finally acquiesced and allowed him to enter his father's study. Cormac's face was assaulted with a huge plume of dust as he opened the door to the long sealed room. The room was dark save for a streak of light coming from between the dull brown curtains. Flecks of dust played through the beams of light, looking almost like snow.

While his father had been alive Cormac was never allowed into the study. It was the one room in the house that nobody except his father was allowed to enter, and it had remained that way after he had died. The room, other than the layers of dust, was surprisingly clean. There were several notebooks on the desk, and a few pens. The flower vase now contained only a dried up stem.

The chair squeaked slightly as Cormac sat down in front of a desk that had not seen an occupant for years. He pulled on the drawers but was unable to open them. The key must be somewhere around here, he thought, but there was no sign of it anywhere nearby. There were several glass cabinets at the back of the room that contained various trophies, plaques, and model cars. Most of them were footbal trophies from his father's college days, and there were several "employee of the month" plaques.

In his entire life, Cormac could never get a straight answer from his father what exactly it was he did. These plaques should've at least shed some light on where he worked, but all they ever said was "Employee of the Month" in various different fonts. They didn't even bother to put his name on them. The trophies, too, were strange. None of them had his name, and most of them just had a year and "State University" written on them.

He moved on to the bookshelf on the other side of the window. Half of the first bookshelf was taken up by Encyclopaedia Britannica, and the other half appeared to be old copies of National Geographic. The other bookshelf was more varied, but mostly consisted of generic business and investing books. Towards the bottom of the shelf there was a small section of Tom Clancy novels that seemed to be the only things in the whole bookshelf that had ever been touched.

Cormac was unable to see much else of interest in the room. He started looking more closely at the bookshelf. Maybe his father had one of those lock boxes that looked like a book. Reading the spines of the books wasn't much help, so he tried pulling a few out to look through them. They all just looked like generic business books, but he did notice that a few were written in different languages.

He put the books back and started looking at the encyclopaedias. These seemed even more dull than the rest of the books. His hand scanned the titles of the volumes. Volume 1: A - ANG, Volume 2: ANG - BAR, Volume 3: BAR - CAA, and so on, until he noticed that one of the volumes was sticking out slightly. All of the other volumes were so perfectly lined up, but this one was sticking out.

Without putting much thought into it, Cormac pressed the book back so it would line up with the rest of the shelf. He encountered some resistance as he pushed it, and as he let go of the book, it sprang back into place accompanied by a loud click from behind him.
