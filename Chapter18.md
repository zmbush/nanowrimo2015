# Bombshell

Cormac's heart started beating intensely, he hadn't given her very much thought before. She had only caught his eye because of her hair, but here she was, she had been following him. "Hey", he called out to her as he started walking back her way. She made eye contact with him, smiled, and walked down the street out of his view. The boy broke into a run, calling out to the woman. There must be some reason she had been following him, and he needed to figure out what. Cormac finally made it back out onto the street, and looked wildly in the direction she had run. He saw no sign of her, and he noticed that several pedestrians were giving him weird looks or pointedly not making eye contact. Where could she have gone?

He ran down the street in the direction she had gone, and looked up and down the next street. There weren't very many pedestrians walking around, so he should have been able to see her, but he had no such luck. "Oh well", he thought to himself, "at least she's gone now". His heart was still pounding as he slowly made his way back to the safe house, he circled around the block a few times looking over his shoulder occasionally, but he saw no sign of her. He finally decided that it was safe to try getting into the safe house again, so he walked down the alley towards the rolling door and the pin pad. The door unlatched, and accompanied by the sound of metal on metal, rolled slowly open. Cormac slipped inside. He looked around the small garage, only to find that no company car had been left there. With any luck, one of the other safe houses would be near by, because otherwise he would have to figure out the public transportation to move around this unfamiliar city.

The building inside was similar to the safe house he had used back in Vermont, but it was significantly smaller. He could see no sign that anyone had been using this safe house any time recently, so he figured that he would need to look into the other ones to find Wilson. This time, when he activated the mainframe, several parts of the kitchen had to slide out of the way to make room for the hulking machine. The room, as in Vermont, closed all of its windows, and dimmed the lights before activating the bright fluorescents overhead. The computer before him blazed to life, and he set to work entering in the codes of the other two safe houses. One of them appeared to be several blocks away, but the other was a few miles east, across a bridge. Hopefully the closer one would have a car.

The boy entered in the address of the second safe house into his phone and closed down the mainframe. He left the safe house behind and began the walk to the other one. According to his phone, it would take him thirty minutes to reach it. As he walked, the sky began to dim, and his phone told him it was 5:15. The streets were filled with people, driving their cars, walking towards BART stations, walking home. Nobody seemed to care much about him, except for the various street performers and panhandlers camped on the street. It was around 5:30 by the time Cormac reached the other safe house. He was relieved to see that this house did indeed have a car.

Every company car he had seen so far was the same generic black sedan. There were never any distinguishing markings of features, just plain jet black. Just as the car he had used back in Vermont, this car had the keys in the ignition, and came to life when he turned them. He entered in the code of the final safe house before heading off, the car's navigation was telling him that it was around 15 miles away, and he hoped that the traffic he had seen wasn't the same the whole way. He pulled out into the alleyway, and drove up to the main street. He turned on his signal to turn right, and waited.

Earl Wilson was back at the safe house in Oakland, preparing for the next day. He had spent most of the day tailing his target, but he needed more information from headquarters before he could continue. After he finished making himself some dinner, he activated the safe house mainframe and started doing research. After several minutes of this, a call came in on the mainframe's video phone. The man could see that the call was coming from Holden Anderson. The silhouette of a large bird was displayed with the text "Condor" underneath. This was the last person he was expecting to call him after he had finished with his son. The only reason he could think that the man would call him, was if something had gone wrong. Wilson's adrenaline spiked and his heart started racing as he answered the call, the face of the elder Anderson came on the screen, not immediately angry, but certainly not happy.

"Hello, Condor, what is it?", said Wilson, hoping that some amount of professionalism would cover up the fact that he was starting to shake slightly. He had been so certain that the boy would be fine after his exposure to the serum "Verum Novum". Sure, the previous test subjects had problems, but Earl had only used it to convince the boy to start training, and he made sure that he had no memory of the vision. "It's Cormac, Wilson. He's acting strangely. He's looking for you for some reason, are you sure this doesn't have anything to do with the VN you gave him?" "No, sir, he had no memory of the vision, I made sure of that." "Somehow I doubt that, Wilson", The Condor's eyes narrowed, "my son better start behaving like a sane human being soon, or it'll be your head"

The screen went black, but the elder Anderson's threat still rang through Wilson's head, but soon that was replaced by another thought. "He's looking for you for some reason". That was what Holden had said, right? Earl wasn't excited about the prospect that the boy was looking for him. If he had somehow remembered what he had seen, who knows what he could be thinking. He thought back to some of the test subjects during VN's initial testing, many of them threatened to kill themselves or others, and almost all of them had developed some level of paranoia. Most of them simply couldn't accept that the things they had seen were not real. "At least", Wilson assured himself, "he won't be able to find me while I'm on mission". With that realization, he was able to focus again on work, but only just.

The drive to the third safe house was one of the most horrendous drives that Cormac could ever remember being involved in. The drive to get on to the bridge took almost half an hour, and that was only the first mile. Getting across the bridge took another 45 minutes, so that by the time he finally got off the freeway, it had been almost an hour and a half since he had left the safe house. As he began to slow to surface street speed, he began to get slightly nervous, what if he wasn't able to find Mr. Wilson, who would he be able to turn to? He wasn't sure how much longer he could keep pretending that he didn't know about the cover up before he lost it. He knew that he couldn't go back and live with the impostor, and he couldn't tell his father about what had happened. The familiar rolling metal door opened only to reveal that another car was parked in the spot, perhaps he would be in luck.

He left the car outside and walked into the garage, as the scraping sound of metal filled his ears, he entered the code for the inner door, and walked into the room. It was larger than the one in San Francisco, but still looked almost identical to the previous safe houses he had entered. Cormac looked around at the room, and when he saw no one around, his heart sank. His brain started trying to figure out what it would have to do next, when his eyes fell on the bed in the corner. Unlike the beds in the other houses he had been to, this one was not made neatly, but was a mess of sheets that looked like someone had vacated that particular bed in a hurry.

Upon closer inspection, he saw a sock on the floor, near the door to what he could only assume was the bathroom. The door was closed. He made his way over to the door and knocked, "Hello? Uh, this is...", the boy realized that he had forgotten his code name, "this is Cormac. Are you in there Mr. Wilson?". When there was no response, Cormac's brain started anew scheming alternative plans, until he heard a scuttling sound behind the door. "Wilson? Storm Crow? Are you there?", he tried the door handle only to find it locked. There was renewed scrabbling behind the door, and Cormac began to think that maybe Mr. Wilson was being attacked or held hostage behind that door, had his cover somehow been compromised?

At that point, Cormac realized that the only reasonable solution was to break the door down. The boy took a running start at the door, and slammed into it with his shoulder and all of his body weight. He heard the wood creaking, but the door did not open. He took another pass at the door, slamming into it with as much strength he could muster, and the door swung free from the door frame and into the bathroom. He heard a loud thunk from behind the door, and saw the body of Mr. Wilson squirming on the floor. There was a small window in the bathroom that was ajar, Cormac figured that Mr. Wilson's assailant had run when he had started to break the door down. Good thing he had gotten there in time.

Mr. Wilson had stopped moving, and the boy assumed that his attacker must've hit him over the head or something, so he carried him out of the room and onto the bed. The man was small enough to carry without much effort. Cormac then set about looking for an ice pack for the man's head, and, he realized, some food for himself. When the boy returned, he observed a growing lump on the back of Mr. Wilson's head, so he propped his head up on the ice pack and sat down in a chair opposite him. He couldn't see any other injuries on his body, so he figured that it would just be a waiting game until the man awoke. Cormac ripped into an MRE that he found stored in one of the cabinets and waited for the small man in front of him to wake up.
