# Chapter 3:

As Cormac reached the top of the stairs he gazed upon the ransacked mess of his bedroom. His mom had cleaned up the glass, but nothing else. He began to put his room back in order, hoping in vain that his MacGuffin would be somewhere in the room. Once he had made a first pass at cleaning up, he began to realize that he may never get his MacGuffin back.

He then made his way to the bathroom. The sink was still full of red water, and blood was splattered on the walls and mirrors. He drained the sink and started scrubbing the walls with his already bloodstained towel. No longer able to distract himself with work, his anger about the whole situation began bubbling up. Who could have taken it, and why?

The unanswered questions, and the feeling of violation served to fuel Cormac's fervent scrubbing. It wasn't until he took a momentary breather, that he realized that he had been shredding his towel on the rough wall, and it was now covered in purple fuzz. Why would someone want the MacGuffin? In all the years he'd had it, he hadn't really observed it much. Sure, he knew the patterns that were embossed on its surface, but he never thought of it as much more than a trinket to remember his father by.

Unable to think about much else, he found him self hours later pacing around his room trying in vain to come up with some explanation for what had happened. He glanced towards what was once his bedroom window, but was now a 6 foot by 12 foot hole covered by trash bags and duck tape. Cormac walked downstairs to ask his mother if he could look around in his father's old study. Even though it had been several years, neither of us had been able to bring ourselves to enter or even dust inside his study.

She agreed to let me look inside on the grounds that I don't move anything.
