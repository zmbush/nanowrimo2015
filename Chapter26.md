# The Man Who Left

"Hello Cormac", came the cool voice of his father. The man in front of him was wearing a plain black suit. The same one that all agents were required to wear. He looked at his son with cold dead eyes. He looked tired, more tired than the boy could ever remember him. Cormac couldn't quite figure out how to respond to the man. Here he was, the person that had left him and his mother behind, and never even bothered to say goodbye. Here he was, acting like Cormac was the one at fault.

"You seem agitated, Cormac, why don't you take a seat", he gestured at one of the seats in front of him. He sat in the chair that presumably often contained Ms. Wilkinson, but she was nowhere to be seen. The boy moved forward slowly, not wanting to take his eyes of his father, and sat down in the indicated chair. He looked up at the man, suddenly filled with rage. What gave him the right to say he seems agitated? Of course he seems agitated, he came here trying to kill Ms. Wilkinson, and in her place he finds the man that had abandoned him. "OF COURSE I'M AGITATED!", Cormac roared, vacating his seat. He leaned forward to look at the man in front of him. He looked exactly as Cormac remembered him, the same eyes, the same hair, the same demeanor.

There was no doubt in Cormac's mind that the man in front of him was his father. "Why are you angry with me?", the man in front of him continued in a soothing voice. "WHY THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I'M ANGRY?", Cormac responded, breathing heavily. He stood there for a few moments, expecting the man to respond, but he only sat there looking at him. "YOU LEFT ME", he continued, starting to get some momentum in his tirade, "YOU LEFT MOM". The man continued to stare at him, cocking his head to one side. Cormac couldn't help but continue to fill with rage as he looked at the calm demeanor of the man in front of him. What the fuck gave him the right to be so fucking calm. "WHY DID YOU LEAVE US?", Cormac finished.

The man blinked at him, apparently expecting more shouting, but none was forthcoming. "Cormac..." he started, before pausing, "Didn't they tell you?". Cormac sat back down in the chair staring at the man, his eyes slits, teeth gritting, "Tell. Me. What". The man in front of him shook his head, looking sad, "Cormac...", he started again. He didn't seem to know how to say what he wanted to say, when he finally seemed to find his words he told him, "I'm... Dead".

Cormac blinked. He opened his mouth, and then he closed it again. He turned his head to the side, and then to the other side. Had he heard that correctly? He looked at the man, not a trace of mirth or irony in his face, and he could see that the man in front of him looked entirely dissimilar to his father. Sure he still had his eyes and his hair, but his face was sallow, his eye sockets were sunken in. The skin on his neck seemed thin and droopy, it looked as if it was melting off of his body. The suit must have hidden it before, but now Cormac saw that his father was emaciated and somehow altogether smaller than he had remembered him.

The man in front of him was at the same time entirely his father, and entirely not. Cormac continued to stare at him. Somehow, the fact that he was staring at his father, and his father was explaining in a calm if not sad voice that he was in fact entirely dead, did not phase Cormac. For some reason it seemed entirely reasonable that this man he was talking to could in fact be his father, and so he continued his conversation. "What do you mean, dead? What happened?", he asked, not sure where to begin.

The man took a deep breath and began to explain. "It was while you were gone, I got sick", he started, halting for what seemed like an eternity on every word. "We didn't want to worry you while you were overseas, you were under enough stress as it was, and we had hoped that we would be able to give you the good news that I was better, rather than the news that I was sick", the eyes of his father stared at him, sad, but calm, the face of a man that has resigned himself to his fate. The man sighed, and continued, "I guess it's a bit too late to say I'm sorry Cormac, but I really am. I never expected this thing to get the best of me, but it has. The doctors tell me that I only have a few days to live. Your mother and I want to make sure that you get to fight for what you believe in, but unfortunately, there is little chance you would be able to make it here in time".

Cormac noticed that there were tears streaming down his face, his throat seemed to be filled with a rock as he choked a response, "But I'm here now! What are you talking about?!". The man continued, seeming to take no notice of his son's outburst, "I always thought that you were the brightest kid in the world, but I guess I didn't tell you it enough. Looking back on things when you're nearing the end gives you some perspective. I love you son. I am so proud of all that you've accomplished, and I know you will accomplish so much more. Take care of your mom for me, okay?", his face filled with involuntary tears as he reached forward fiddling with the air in front of him. "Goodbye, Cormac", was the last thing he said before he vanished.

Cormac's eyes were brimming with tears, as he reached forward towards the man that had just been in front of him. He was dimly aware that in the place of his father was a small television on wheels in front of him. His throat felt so tight that he could barely breathe. The boy just sat there, blinking, struggling to breathe, staring blankly forward. He could hear voices behind him, but it was all strangely muffled. The door behind him burst open, and several large men in white suits piled in. Cormac looked around, seeing the room as if for the first time. He felt hands grasp his arms and wrestle the plastic knife he was holding out of his hands. The hands dragged him backwards and he fell out of his chair, feet dragging behind him.

He could see some sounds of shouting, and the alarm was still blaring. His eyes cleared of tears for long enough to see back into the room from which he was pulling. He finally could see that what he had been staring at the whole time he was in the room was a television, and behind that screen was Sandra Wilkinson. She looked at Cormac, with a mix of pity and anger. "Had she been there the whole time?", Cormac wondered. Someone was standing by the door as he was dragged out of it, and they slammed the door shut.

Cormac felt a pinching sensation in his left arm, and looked over to see a needle poking out of it. He made a motion to pull it out, but found that the men were holding him too tightly for him to move at all. Before long the whole world faded into blackness as whatever they had injected him with took full effect.

When Cormac awoke, he was not clear where he was. His face felt sticky, and his whole body was extremely sore. He opened his eyes, and around him he saw nothing but darkness. He was instantly reminded of the training facility that he had been at with Mr. Wilson, when he had first woken up there all those months ago. He tried to sit up, but found with a sudden jolt of adrenaline that he was strapped down to the bed. He looked around, desperately searching the darkness for any sign of light. All he saw was the slight blinking light of what he could only assume was a fire alarm somewhere high above him.

He was sure that he had been somehow brought back to the facility. He knew that there was really no way for him to be so certain, but it was the only thing that made sense. He was certain that he had been taken away after his botched assassination attempts to be re-trained at the training facility. The last time he had left this place, he had left with little or no memory of his mother's death and the revenge he wanted to seek for it. Surely this time, he would be made to forget all about his plot, all about Ms. Wilkinson and Mr. Greene, all about his father.

His father. He remembered his father from the previous day, he had looked so sickly, so close to death. Was he really dead? Who had he been talking to then? He was so certain that his father was still alive, that he was a member of TSA. He had even talked with him, asked him for information about Mr. Wilson. He had seemed just as cold, just as standoffish as Cormac could remember him. Except, Cormac thought, he wasn't cold and standoffish. Now that he really thought about it, the man he had been so angry at wasn't the monster he remembered him as.

Sure, he was strict, but Cormac had always just assumed that that was because he wanted what was best for him. He made sure that Cormac got good grades, went out for sports. He encouraged him to make good friends, and he was certainly not as absent as Cormac remembered him as. He had become so wrapped up in this narrative that his father was this horrible person that had abandoned him and his mother, that he had forgotten the man that had raised him. The man that had taught him how to throw a football so he could go out for the high school team. The man that had smiled so widely and so proudly when Cormac was boarding the plane to Iraq.

Cormac remembered, the man that he had sent him so many letters during his tour, and had always seemed so excited for his return. He remembered coming home, looking forward to seeing his father and mother only to find that his father had died while he was away. He remembered the feelings of betrayal, that his mother had not told him, that nobody had told him anything. As hard as he tried, however, Cormac could not remember what had happened after that. He remembered coming home, the hurt, the arguments with his mother, and then he was training for TSA.

He strained against the straps that held him down. He didn't want to forget all this again. Sure, it hurt, but it was better than not knowing. It was better than thinking that his father was alive and that he had just abandoned him. It was better than searching for a man that he would never find. It was better than whatever he had been doing in the years since he returned from Iraq. He tried to figure out just what he had been doing. He could remember a job, he had a job at MCI doing data entry. He tried to picture his office, but he couldn't remember what it looked like. He tried to imagine his boss, Mr. Coleman, but the face that came to mind was Mr. Wilson's. He tried so hard to remember what he had been doing with his life, but it felt like a dream that was fading away, soon to be forgotten in the waking hours.
