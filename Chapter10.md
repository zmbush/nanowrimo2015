# Company Man

Cormac was running away from the demented dwarf as he had become so accustomed to over the last month. He had gotten to the point lately that he was able to outstrip the tiny man almost every time he tried, but today he felt Mr. Wilson's arms wrap around his leg and felt his leg slip out from under him. The boy didn't have any time to properly react as he saw the icy ground hurtling up to meet him. He attempted to lift his arms to protect his face, but only succeeded in punching himself in the chest. He felt blood dripping down his neck and out of his nose, but all he could think about was how much he just wanted to murder this little asshole. He hadn't been able to properly relax for the last 2 months, and it was starting to take its toll on him. After asking the little man what he wanted, Cormac listened to the endlessly rehashed story of "I need you to listen to me" and "Your father is going to kill me". If the fucking prick wanted him to do something, he was going to have to come to Cambridge and make him. After not seeing him for 3 years, this hardly seemed likely.

The boy left the small man laying on the sidewalk, and without looking back, left him. Cormac was so sick of this fucking midget following him around all day. His father had never expressed any interest in him when he was a kid, so why did he give a shit now? All the boy ever wanted to do was just live a normal life, work a normal job, and be a better person than his father had ever been. Cormac never really grew attached to his father, and whenever he thinks back to his childhood, it was no surprise to him. "Okay, son", he could recall his father telling him, "today I'm going to teach you how to survive in the wilderness". He never seemed to care about what Cormac wanted to do, and in fact seemed oblivious to the fact that on nearly all of these "training missions", his son had all but blocked out his most important and pivotal lessons. The only thing that Cormac could even remember from those times, was his father chiding him when he failed to tie whatever knot he had been showing him, or sitting with a blank expression when Holden had clearly told him to do something very important. Cormac usually spent most of his time with his father trying to think of other things he would rather be doing.

As Cormac rounded the corner, the midget left his field of view and he was able to breathe a little bit easier. Nothing he seemed to be able to do had deterred the little man, and the boy was starting to loose hope that he was ever going to have a relaxing walk to work alone again. Thankfully, it appeared that the Mr. Wilson had given up for the day, and for that, Cormac breathed a sigh of relief. He touched his nose gingerly as he walked. It didn't feel broken, but it still hurt, and the blood was still slowly oozing down onto his lip. The gash in his chin seemed to have stopped bleeding, but his shirt was stained with blood. His boss wasn't going to like this, but he never gave the man any trouble, so he was hoping that his boss would let it slide. Regardless, he didn't have any time to stop at home, and he was already outside the building so he just went in. Cormac counted his blessings as his boss didn't even look up from his desk when he walked past. Cormac made it to his desk without much notice, sliding his way past coworkers whose names he couldn't remember and to his desk in the back corner of the office where nobody ever looked his way. Just the way he liked it.

"Today was going to be a nice relaxing day", was all that Cormac could think as he sat down at his desk and grabbed the first paper on his considerable "IN" pile. This batch of papers was the same as the batches of paper he had been handling for the past few weeks and he knew it like the back of his hand. At this point he could do the entire action reflexively, and barely needed to pay any attention. His hands flew over the keyboard as he checked each field on the form in front of him. This was one of the good ones, this person had filled out the form on his computer before sending it in and Cormac needed to pay even less attention than usual. Not that handwritten forms were particularity difficult for him. His years at this job had, above all else trained his ability to read even the most chicken scratch handwritten forms.

Every time Cormac finished another form, he placed it face down in the "OUT" pile on the right side of his desk. And it was like this that his day, and in fact most days, continued. Pick up form. Transcribe data. Put the form in the out pile. Pick up form. Transcribe data. Put the form in the out pile. Pick up form. Transcribe data. Put form in the out pile. Rinse. Lather. Repeat. It was this repetitive mindless task that allowed Cormac to continue to use the skills he had honed over his many years ignoring what his father was saying to him. He thought about the X-Files. He thought about his mom. He looked around his office and felt ever so slightly superior to everyone else. All of them seemed to be so thoroughly focused on their task, while Cormac could do this shit with his hand tied behind his back. In this place, he could outshine anyone.

But he chose not to. In all those years of his father trying to drill into him assertiveness, and gravitas, and general likeableness. In all those years, the only thing he had learned, was how much he didn't want to be like his father. Whenever his father tried to thrust those things upon him, he just continued to rub in how much of a prick he was. As he grew, Cormac took that to heart and that was why he never wanted to shine or be seen by much of anyone. He could outshine anyone in this company, but he was content sitting in the corner of the office doing his mundane task, and, occasionally, stealing someone's burrito. He wanted nothing more than to get enough money to help his mother pay the mortgage, and to have enough money to pay for his Netflix subscription. Three months ago, he had that. Three months ago, he had the MacGuffin, and he still had a window. Three months ago, he didn't have a fucking midget in a trench coat following him around everywhere. Three months ago, life was simpler.

As lunch time rolled around, Cormac contemplated running off to the break room to try to scrounge up some food, but instead he decided to work through lunch and leave a half hour earlier. When he started working at this job, he was really worried about his boss or his coworkers getting mad at him, and so he made considerable effort to get into work before the rest of his coworkers, and to leave only after the rest of them had gone home. It took him several months to finally realize that nobody in the office cared how much he worked. That bitchy woman who sits three desks away from him? She gets all kind of dirty looks from his boss if she is ever late. The fat guy that always nervously looked towards the break room come lunch time? He couldn't avoid his boss' reproachful gaze on the best day. But Cormac Anderson? Nobody cared. He was such an efficient worker that nobody ever questioned his work ethic or the hours that he worked. Nobody questioned him, nobody talked to him, nobody looked at him. And that was the way he liked it.

His mind continued to wander as the day went on. His "IN" box was dwindling by around 2:30, and he started to slow down his processing slightly. He was starting to be in a rather good mood today despite the events of earlier. The events of earlier. His mind turned back to the midget, sitting on the sidewalk pleading with him to become a scumbag like him. Like my father. The small man's face had filled with fear when Cormac had stared him down this morning, and couldn't quite figure out why. Once the midget had entered Cormac's brain, he could think of nothing else for the remainder of the day. How long was this tiny man going to follow him around, shout at him in the street, and occasionally tackle him to the ground? It had been two months already, but the little man showed no sign of relenting.

As the last paper of the day fell down into the "OUT" pile, Cormac leaned back in his chair. Somebody would come by later to pick up his "OUT" pile, so he needn't worry about that. His computer beeped as he held down the power button, and he lifted his coat from the back of his chair as he stood up to leave. He walked past all of the desks, and nodded to his boss as he passed. The boy reached the doors to the building and, expecting that the midget would be outside, took a deep breath before making his way out into the cold. Cormac began walking down his usual route home, occasionally looking over his shoulder to look for Mr. Wilson to be following him. It wasn't until the boy had made it almost all the way home that he began to consider the possibility that the small man wasn't going to appear without warning to accost him.

Surprised and cautiously optimistic, Cormac finally reached home and walked up the steps to his front door. He paused for a moment, something felt... Wrong... It seemed too quiet. He slowly unlocked and opened the front door, and his nose was immediately greeted with the smell of bleach. "Mom?" he called out. Had she run out of the normal kitchen cleaner? She had occasionally taken to pouring bleach all over the kitchen to clean it in the months after his father's disappearance, but she had been fine for a long time. "Hello?" he called out again. There was no sign of her in the kitchen, where Cormac was used to finding her at this time of day. "Mom, where are you?" he yelled down the hallway to his mother's room. He walked down the hallway, the bleach smell getting so much stronger that his eyes started to water. The door to her bedroom was open, and the lights were off inside. He grabbed on to the door frame to steady himself as another wave of bleach smell, bleach and something else, assaulted his senses. He had a hard time keeping his eyes open but he continued around the corner.

On the bed in the dark room, was his mother. Cormac could tell that there was something wrong as he crept his way towards her. Her arms and legs were lying in abnormal positions, and her head was twisted away from him. In the dim light, he could see that she was still wearing her clothes from work that day. "Mom?" he called again, nearly screaming this time. Cormac flipped the light switch. The lights in the room flickered on as if they too didn't want to see what was on display. Nothing could have prepared Cormac for what he saw. Lying in the center of the large queen mattress, surrounded by a pool of stick red liquid, was his mother. Cormac knew, without even getting close to her, that she was dead. He circled around to the other side of the bed and was greeted by the gaunt, vacant expression of the one person that had ever cared for him. His stomach churned and he felt nausea welling up inside him as he looked down on his mother, her neck slit open a look of terror in her eyes. All at once, everything got to him, he fell to his knees, turned away from the bed and heaved repeatedly, until every ounce of food and acid that had once filled his stomach instead stained the formerly pristine carpet. The boy struggled to his feet and stumbled out of the room. He reached the front door of his house, gasping for air and hurled himself out onto the street. He lay there, gasping, crying, and dry heaving for at least thirty minutes before a neighbor jogged by and called the police for him.
