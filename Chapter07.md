# The Elder Anderson

"He's pretty pathetic, isn't he?" came a voice from his right. "Are you sure he's your son Anderson?". "He'll get there" was all he could bring himself to say. He couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed in Cormac. Holden "The Condor" Anderson was a decorated agent of The Spy Agency, nearly the top ranking field operative in the entire organization, and he had just witnessed his son fail miserably at the most basic of aptitude tests. He should have had all of the information he needed on hand. The note was barely hidden, and the password could easily be derived from the MacGuffin he had left with him! Come to think of it, Cormac didn't even seem to have the MacGuffin on him.

In his son's entire life, Holden had only ever made a single request: "Keep the MacGuffin with you at all times". Still, even if he _had_ kept it with him, he still panicked in what should not have been a particularly stressful situation. Holden couldn't figure out why Cormac was unable to recall any of the training that his father had given him as a child. He was sure he had given him all the appropriate... "Holden!" came the voice of his commanding officer, knocking him out of his reverie. "You know, most recruits wouldn't even get a second test after a performance like that. But since he's your son, we're willing to give him another chance".

Holden just stared forward at the image of his son sleeping in his bed. The control room slowly drained around him and all that was left was the main monitor. He was only dimly aware that the room around him was completely empty by the time he looked away from the disappointment that his son had become. When he was younger, Cormac had always seemed like he was going to take after his father, always excited to be around him and hanging on his every word. Holden thought back to the dark brown eyes staring intently at him as he walked his son through various methods of survival and critical thinking. As Holden closed the door behind him he heard the sound of the lights and screens turning down and the hum of the generator slowing and eventually falling silent.

His footsteps echoed off the concrete walls as he walked down the hallway towards the exit of the bunker. As the last person leaving the facility, the lights continued to go dark as he passed with loud clangs. He had only taken a short break from his mission when he had heard that his son had found his way into the testing chamber. He was so hopeful that his son would do well, but was met only with the sight of his son having a panic attack. Now his only hope of getting over that shame was to make sure that Cormac passed the test the next time he attempted it. And, in fact, to make sure that he takes the test again.

Several hours and several phone calls later, Holden found himself feeling much better about his son's prospects for his next test. Much, much better. It had taken some convincing, but he had called in every favor he could to make sure that Cormac would get the best -- training -- around. Now all that was left was for Holden to return to the task at hand, and let his plan go into action.

The stairs out of the bunker were just wide enough for a single person to walk through comfortably. On either side of the wall, there were dome shaped fluorescent lights evenly spaced on alternating sides of the hallway. The bunkers were always kept quite cool inside in spite of whatever temperatures were outside, and the only scent to be found is the faint scent of dust and chlorine. As The Condor reached the top of the stairs, he paused for a moment before he opened up the heavy metal door. He reached out a hand for the door and pushed it forward. The wall of heat and humidity that he met on the other side nearly knocked him back down the staircase.

How TSA was able to keep those bunkers so cool and dry he would never understand, but he almost always hated leaving them when he was out in this part of the world. He had been down there for several hours, and the heat of the mid day sun had turned this tent into a sauna. Even with the heavy canvas blocking out the direct heat, it still filled and permeated every part of the room. Mere moments after returning to the outside world, agent Anderson began sweating. He quickly made his way over to the row of lockers placed against one side of the cavernous tent, and pulled out his more "climate appropriate" outfit.

Even once he had taken off his suit, and donned his much cooler desert gear, he still continued to sweat profusely. He had never been able to adjust to the humidity of this place, having grown up and lived most of his life in the north-eastern United States. Still, the new outfit was an improvement.

In stark contrast to the cold grey interior of the bunker, the tent he was now inside of was bright, tan, dirty. The flaps of the tent parted easily as Holden walked through them. He raised his hand up to protect his eyes from the sudden direct assault from the sun, and pulled his sunglasses out of his pocket. The camp here was small, perhaps only a dozen tents, surrounded by a short barbed wire fence with an entrance to the north, and to the east. The southwestern corner of the camp was bordered by a steep cliff face, so that in the evening the sun didn't shine directly on the camp.

From what he could tell, it seems like he had been in the bunker for several hours. It had been dawn by the time he arrived, and now the sun was directly overhead. With the knowledge that his son was going to be taken care of, he felt comfortable heading back to his current outstanding mission, so he headed back to the tiny single seater airplane, and left. He flew along the cliff edge for several minutes and then he flew to the south.
