# The Waiting Game

Cormac returned again to his safe house and began trying to search for any information he could glean about the man who called himself Mr. Tripp. The last name wasn't much help, the database had over 20,000 people listed with the last name Tripp. He had never met a Tripp before, but the boy supposed that the name must be more common than he had realized. The boy racked his brain trying to figure out any characteristics that Mr. Tripp had that could help him identify the man, but he was so generic looking. His face, plain. His hair and eyes were brown, his suit had no name brand visible, and he wore plain black shoes and pants. There wasn't anything he could think of that could distinguish the man from any of the other countless generic "Agent" types. This was, Cormac soon realized, a dead end.

The boy decided to instead try to focus on his targets. He would start by trying to look up Sandra Wilkinson online. He couldn't get much information about her work inside TSA, but perhaps there would be something about her on the web. She didn't just appear out of nowhere. The only downside about this tactic is that all the information he had about Die Faust, was her name, and her approximate age. He had no idea what she looked like, indeed nobody inside the organization really knew what she looked like. Most people also assumed that she was a man, a crime of which Cormac had also been a perpetrator. He found references to a 16 year old girl that had been abducted 40 odd years ago, which would make her roughly the same age. He found a Sarah Wilkinson that appeared to be an online artist, but she had very little personal information about her online.

He continued searching in this way for hours, never finding less than thirty possible candidates for who she was. As this wasn't getting him anywhere, he turned his attention to Mr. Greene. This search, however proved to be even less useful. He saw references to a director, a Canadian politician, an artist that had died back in the late 90s, but nothing that seemed even remotely useful. His father, he knew the most about, but he could find very little additional information about him online. He wished that his mother was still alive so he could talk to her about him, but alas. The sun had long set by the time that Cormac finally decided that his search was going nowhere. How was he supposed to take down these people if he couldn't even figure out who they really were.

* * *

His search continued in this way for several weeks. He would go to work, spend several fruitless hours at the safe house trying to find more information about his targets, and then he would go to sleep and repeat. He would on occasion check up on Mr. Wilson to see if he was yet done with his assignment, but he continued to be on assignment, and Cormac couldn't be sure when he would be done. On several occasions, he had considered flying back to San Francisco to try to talk with the man again, but he knew that was liable to get him noticed by the upper management, and he couldn't stand that kind of scrutiny.

One night in early February, he was sitting as usual in his chair at the safe house. He hadn't so much as spoken to anyone in almost a month, when he heard someone clear their throats behind him. Cormac felt like he was about to fly through the ceiling with how badly he flinched, adrenaline pouring through his whole body. He stood up, throwing his chair backwards, and bolted across the room before he was able to look up and see who had entered the safe house. The woman before him was immediately familiar to him, but it took him several moments before he recognized the face of the pretty blond woman that had followed him around during his trip to the bay area.

The woman who he had only ever known as Ms. Nettheit had almost completely escaped his memory as he had focused on trying to learn as much as he could about the trio that had become his obsession. He stood there, staring at the woman suspiciously as he tried to figure out how she had gotten in. He couldn't remember if he had closed the door behind him, but he was almost certain that he had. He almost never left the door open, and yet, here she was. He looked at the door. It was closed. "I'm a TSA agent, remember?", she finally said seemingly reading his mind, "I don't know how you didn't notice me enter, but you were so focused on the computer". He felt his body relax slightly, and immediately tense up again. Yes, she was a TSA agent, so that would explain why she was able to enter the safe house. On the other hand what was a TSA agent doing here, unless she was investigating him.

Perhaps his constant searches for information about the upper management of this organization had not gone unnoticed. He tried hard to not let his out of control heart rate betray his fear, as he peered at her. "What are you doing here?", he asked her, not expecting a proper reply. "I could ask you the same thing. You're not on an official mission, are you?", she looked at him, smiling, "You know these safe houses are only supposed to be used for missions, right?" Cormac could do nothing but stare at the woman, was she being serious with him? He was aware that that was the official company policy, but was she going to rat him out?

After what felt like several tense minutes, she finally laughed and looked at him in disbelief. "I know you're a new agent and all, but you really need to lighten up", she said through her chuckles. "Anyway, the reason I really came here was to ask you if you had thought about what I had said", she continued, dropping her pretense of humor, "I was checking in with you to make sure you weren't going to do anything stupid. This organization is forgiving of small mistakes, but you should stop before they become bigger". Her hand reached for his shoulder, but he pulled back instinctively. She looked at him with a face of concern, and continued forward. As Cormac continued to back away, he found himself backed up against the bed in the back of the room.

He fell backwards and she looked down at him. Her face was filled with something approaching pity, or perhaps even sadness. She shook her head and left the room. Cormac lay there for several minutes before he moved again. He wasn't sure why, but the woman made him uncomfortable. She always talked to him like he was going to freak out at any moment, and he couldn't figure out why. She was always just vague enough that he couldn't figure out what exactly she was trying to tell him, but he finally decided that the higher ups at TSA must have finally started to notice his behavior, so he would need to move soon.

Ideally, he would get back in contact with Mr. Wilson, but if he couldn't pull that off, he would need to do something on his own. He returned to the mainframe to look up information on Mr. Wilson, and found that he was finally done with whatever mission he had been on, and he was heading back to headquarters. This would be a perfect opportunity for Cormac to meet up with the small man to make some plans. He still had no meaningful way to contact the man, but he figured he could just head to headquarters and wait for the small man in his office. The drive wasn't too long, and he hoped that he would make it back to headquarters before the other man did. If he could just make it there in time, he would be able to get the information he needed.

Mr. Wilson was at a high enough level at TSA that Cormac hoped he would have the access to the information he would need to take down his trio of targets. He headed out of the safe house, bringing with him the last of his hot pockets and water bottles. He wasn't sure how long he would be gone, and he needed to make sure that he wouldn't need to stop on the way down. He had microwaved the hot pockets shortly before he left so even though they would be cold, at least they wouldn't be frozen.

The drive down was very similar to his previous trip. He left much later in the day this time, so by the time he made it to Albany, it was already sunrise. He had eaten two of his hot pockets, and drank most of his water, and he was exhausted. He drove into the parking lot and resisted the urge to sleep. He forced himself to leave the car and head up to try to find Mr. Wilson's office. He had checked before he left, and had found that the small man had an office on the 18th floor, almost at the top of the building. It shouldn't be too difficult for him to find the small man's office.

The elevator ride was quite fast, he felt the pressure of gravity trying to compress him into the floor as the small box moved upwards. The elevator dinged and he walked out into a hallway that looked very similar to the one he had seen on his last visit. The only difference he could spot was the paintings on the walls. The carpet, paint, and light fixtures were all the same. He walked down the hallway looking left and right, reading the names on all of the office doors. He finally stopped in front of a door with the name "Storm Crow" written upon it.

He walked inside, and sat down in the one chair in the room. He leaned back, facing the door, and promptly fell asleep.
