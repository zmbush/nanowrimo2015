# The Waiting Game

Cormac returned again to his safe house and began trying to search for any information he could glean about the man who called himself Mr. Tripp. The last name wasn't much help, the database had over 20,000 people listed with the last name Tripp. He had never met a Tripp before, but the boy supposed that the name must be more common than he had realized. The boy racked his brain trying to figure out any characteristics that Mr. Tripp had that could help him identify the man, but he was so generic looking. His face, plain. His hair and eyes were brown, his suit had no name brand visible, and he wore plain black shoes and pants. There wasn't anything he could think of that could distinguish the man from any of the other countless generic "Agent" types. This was, Cormac soon realized, a dead end.

The boy decided to instead try to focus on his targets. He would start by trying to look up Sandra Wilkinson online. He couldn't get much information about her work inside TSA, but perhaps there would be something about her on the web. She didn't just appear out of nowhere. The only downside about this tactic is that all the information he had about Die Faust, was her name, and her approximate age. He had no idea what she looked like, indeed nobody inside the organization really knew what she looked like. Most people also assumed that she was a man, a crime of which Cormac had also been a perpetrator. He found references to a 16 year old girl that had been abducted 40 odd years ago, which would make her roughly the same age. He found a Sarah Wilkinson that appeared to be an online artist, but she had very little personal information about her online.

He continued searching in this way for hours, never finding less than thirty possible candidates for who she was. As this wasn't getting him anywhere, he turned his attention to Mr. Greene. This search, however proved to be even less useful. He saw references to a director, a Canadian politician, an artist that had died back in the late 90s, but nothing that seemed even remotely useful. His father, he knew the most about, but he could find very little additional information about him online. He wished that his mother was still alive so he could talk to her about him, but alas. The sun had long set by the time that Cormac finally decided that his search was going nowhere. How was he supposed to take down these people if he couldn't even figure out who they really were.

His search continued in this way for several weeks. He would go to work, spend several fruitless hours at the safe house trying to find more information about his targets, and then he would go to sleep and repeat. He would on occasion check up on Mr. Wilson to see if he was yet done with his assignment, but he continued to be on assignment, and Cormac couldn't be sure when he would be done. On several occasions, he had considered flying back to San Francisco to try to talk with the man again, but he knew that was liable to get him noticed by the upper management, and he couldn't stand that kind of scrutiny.

One night in early February, he was sitting as usual in his chair at the safe house. He hadn't so much as spoken to anyone in almost a month, when he heard someone clear their throats behind him. Cormac felt like he was about to fly through the ceiling with how badly he flinched, adrenaline pouring through his whole body. He stood up, throwing his chair backwards, and bolted across the room before he was able to look up and see who had entered the safe house. The woman before him was immediately familiar to him, but it took him several moments before he recognized the face of the pretty blond woman that had followed him around during his trip to the bay area.

The woman who he had only ever known as Ms. Nettheit had almost completely escaped his memory as he had focused on trying to learn as much as he could about the trio that had become his obsession. He stood there, staring at the woman suspiciously as he tried to figure out how she had gotten in. He couldn't remember if he had closed the door behind him, but he was almost certain that he had. He almost never left the door open, and yet, here she was. He looked at the door. It was closed. "I'm a TSA agent, remember?", she finally said seemingly reading his mind, "I don't know how you didn't notice me enter, but you were so focused on the computer". He felt his body relax slightly, and immediately tense up again. Yes, she was a TSA agent, so that would explain why she was able to enter the safe house. On the other hand what was a TSA agent doing here, unless she was investigating him.

Perhaps his constant searches for information about the upper management of this organization had not gone unnoticed. He tried hard to not let his out of control heart rate betray his fear, as he peered at her. "What are you doing here?", he asked her, not expecting a proper reply. "I could ask you the same thing. You're not on an official mission, are you?", she looked at him, smiling, "You know these safe houses are only supposed to be used for missions, right?"
