# Chapter 6: Stuck

As his body calmed down, he started to become more aware of the sounds in the room. He could once again hear his breathing, he could hear his heartbeat in his ears, but he could no longer hear the fan from the computer. He lifted his head to look towards his only chance of rescue, and saw that the screen had turned black.

He pushed himself up onto shaking legs, and stumbled towards the computer. As he approached, he saw, where the keyboard had been sitting, a post-it note. As he got close enough to read it, he found that it was a note written in his father's handwriting. It said:

```
Cormac:

I'm sorry that I am unable to say goodbye
to you or your mother, but please
understand that I was unable to stay.

The user name of this terminal is
"Condor", and I gave you the password
before I left. Use the command "unlock"
to get out of this room, and please don't
come looking for me.

-H
```
