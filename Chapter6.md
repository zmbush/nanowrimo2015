# Chapter 6: Stuck

As his body calmed down, he started to become more aware of the sounds in the room. He could once again hear his breathing, he could hear his heartbeat in his ears, but he could no longer hear the fan from the computer. He lifted his head to look towards his only chance of rescue, and saw that the screen had turned black.

He pushed himself up onto shaking legs, and stumbled towards the computer. As he approached, he saw, where the keyboard had been sitting, a post-it note. As he got close enough to read it, he found that it was a note written in his father's handwriting. It said:


```
Cormac:

I'm sorry that I am unable to say
goodbye to you or your mother, but
please understand that I was unable to
stay.

The user name of this terminal is
"Condor", and I gave you the password
before I left.  Use the command "unlock"
to get out of this room, and please
don't come looking for me.

-H
```

What did he mean by "I gave you the password"? Cormac couldn't remember any password. First he'd have to get the computer started up again. He retrieved the keyboard from the ground, part of the heavy plastic had chipped off from the side, but it looked like it would still work. The sound of rolling wheels filled up the room as he pulled the chair back towards the desk. He sat back down and, held his breath, and pressed a few keys on the keyboard. After a few agonizingly slow seconds, the sound of the fan returned, and the screen blinked back to life.

Once again, the screen was black save for a single innocent looking `console login:` taunting him. He entered the user name from the note and sat staring at the `Password:` prompt trying to figure out what password his father had given him. He had vanished several years ago with no warning, and the police were never able to find his body. Apparently, he left of his own volition. Still, Cormac could not think of what the password was. The only thing his father had ever given him was...

The MacGuffin! Cormac could remember that there was something written on it, but he had always assumed that it was just some stupid inspirational quote. "We accept what love we think we deserve" or something like that. Could that somehow be the password? Maybe it's just the phrase? That seemed too long to be a password. He'd heard that some people use the first letters of the words in a quote they liked, so maybe the password was "wawlwtwd"? It was worth a shot. He stared at the keyboard intently as he typed out the letters and pressed enter.

`Login incorrect`. "What the fuck?" he cried out in frustration. Maybe he remembered the quote wrong? He never gave much thought to the quote itself, so he could've forgotten the exact wording. Maybe there was a picture of the MacGuffin on his phone! He always carried it with him, so it may have been in the background of a picture at one point. He pulled out his phone and started swiping through his pictures.
