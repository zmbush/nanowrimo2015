# Long Lost

There before Cormac, pacing around his office, was a man that he hardly recognized. The boy could tell by the way the man looked at him, that he did not recognize him. The man, his father, couldn't even recognize his son's face. It was to be expected, he was hardly at home during his teens, and then in his early twenties, he disappeared. Why would he recognize the face of his only son. Holden Anderson continued to stare at his son with something approaching recognition. "Hello, father" Cormac finally said, giving his father the hint he needed to realize who the person before him was. "Cormac? What are you doing here? I though you were living with your mother?" He didn't know. How could he not know? She was his wife, even if he abandoned her, shouldn't he have at least kept tabs on her? He sent her to the bottle after he left, so shouldn't he at least give a shit if she was brutally murdered?

Cormac nearly started screaming at his father, give him a piece of how much of an asshole he had been to him. But wait. Maybe he did know... Maybe he was part of the cover-up? Could he have sent the impostor to pose as his mother. Try to keep him at home, lure him into complacency so that he couldn't put his training to use. He had joined TSA to get contacts and perhaps some help tracking down his mother's killer, but maybe they just wanted to have the son of "The Condor" around. But for what? Nothing really made sense right now, and he couldn't be sure who to trust. He couldn't let on that he knew his father's involvement in the cover up, so he would have to casually try to get information about Mr. Wilson. "Yes, I have been living with her. I was in contact with 'Storm Crow' recently, and I have been trying to find him. I believe he has some information I need."

"Look at you, you sound just like your old man", Holden said, grinning. "Do you know where I can find him?", Cormac asked impatiently, he didn't want to deal with his father right now, and he was having a hard time not punching the man. "Last I heard, he was on mission somewhere in California. I can give you the locations of a few safe houses he may be using, but you're really not supposed to interrupt an agent while on assignment unless it's an emergency", Cormac's father looked at him as if to say "this is an emergency, right?". Cormac nodded at his father, and he wrote down three numbers on a scrap of paper. Every safe house that TSA controlled was given a unique ID number, with these, Cormac should be able to find out where Mr. Wilson was hiding out. Cormac snatched the piece of paper from his father's hand, and started for the door.

"Cormac", he heard as he closed the door, "I'm proud of you". "Yeah, now he's proud of me", though Cormac, face burning red hot, "now that I've become what he always really wanted me to become". When the boy once again reached the parking lot, he found the car he had brought still parked where he had left it. Most of the company cars were able to be commandeered by anyone who needed it, so he was always glad to see the same familiar vehicle still there. He turned the car on, and searched for the nearest airport on the on board computer and found that the airport was only about 10 miles away. He also keyed in a request to purchase a plane ticket from Albany to San Francisco. As an agent, one was given an almost unlimited budget for travel expenses as long as it could be justified as a business expense. Right now, Cormac didn't particularly care about justifying this expense.

20 minutes later, Cormac arrived at the airport, parked his car, and walked into the terminal. He found the nearest kiosk to pick up his ticket and found that one had already been purchased for him. The man behind the counter handed him a small envelope with his ticket, and a California drivers license with the name James Cobb. The plane was leaving in about thirty minutes, so he would have to hurry to get through the security checkpoint. He had seen the circus that is airport in many a sitcom over the years, but he had never really flown anywhere before. The process went much smoother than he had expected, the checkpoint went rather quickly, and nobody seemed to care about him. Fifteen minutes later, he found himself waiting in the terminal for his flight number to be called out.

* * *

A pretty blonde woman who looked to be in her early twenties sat down next to Cormac. She too didn't appear to have any carry on luggage, and he was just about to comment on it when he heard his flight number called out over the PA system. He stood up, nodding to the woman only to see that she was standing up as well. She walked shortly behind him to the gate, and after having her ticket checked, followed him down the walkway to the plane. Once inside, Cormac took his seat near the front of the plane, and she took a seat several rows back, and on the other side of the plane. Once she sat down, Cormac could no longer see her, and as the cabin filled up with people, she fell out of his mind entirely.

After sitting for what seemed like half an hour waiting for the plane to slowly fill up with people, he saw the stewardesses explaining proper emergency guidelines, and then she told everyone to fasten their seatbelts and prepare for takeoff. On the seat in front of Cormac there was a small television, he could see that there was a set of B movies planned to be played, which brought him back to all the time he had spent at home watching netflix and caring for little more than what he would do the following day at work. He watched the movies as the plane flew towards his final destination, distracted slightly from his task at hand, thinking wistfully back to the simpler times before the midget that he had come to know as Mr. Wilson had started following him around. Simpler times before his MacGuffin had been stolen. Before he had gotten locked in the chamber below his father's study. And most of all, Before he had seen his mother murdered.

Once his brain returned back to this thought, he couldn't think of much else. Whatever shitty movie he had been watching suddenly couldn't distract him, and he could only imagine his mother, neck covered in bright purple bruises, eyes wide and terrified. That night had been the worst in his life. Despite his father's overbearing nature, his mother had always been there for him. Even after his father died and she crawled into a bottle to forget about it, she still made it a point to make sure the house was clean and that Cormac had all that he could want. It made his blood boil to think about the sicko that did that to her. It made him livid to think about whoever was trying to cover it up. Something sinister was going on, and somehow Cormac had found himself in the middle of it all.

He sat for the remainder of the flight, stewing in his own rage. He didn't even realize that he had started muttering under his breath, and the woman sitting next to him had started giving him worried glances. Not nearly soon enough, the plane touched down in San Francisco International airport, and Cormac disembarked. He stood in the center of the airport terminal, reading signs and trying to figure out what to do. He had only taken the time to look up one of the safe houses, and now he didn't have a car whose computer he could use. The only thing he had was the small piece of paper that his father had written numbers on, and the address of one of the safe houses that the boy had written on the back.

He entered in the address into his phone and saw that it was several miles away, in the heart of downtown San Francisco. He quickly realized that his only option was to hire a cab or use public transportation. He decided that public transportation would be less conspicuous. As luck would have it, there was a subway stop inside of the terminal, so he would be able to get on there and ride it very close to his final destination. He started strolling towards the station, across the wide open spaces of the terminal. He could see ahead of him, the blonde hair of the woman that had sat next to him back in New York. He considered walking up to her to strike up a conversation, but it didn't really seem like a great option right now. The boy just needed to focus on the task at hand right now, and that was getting to the first safe house.

He purchased a ticket at the machine, and walked through the plastic turnstile onto the platform. There were small benches at regular intervals down the length of the station, and he sat down at the farthest one and waited for the train. He could see a flashing sign above him blinking "San Francisco/Richmond 3 minutes", and sure enough, three minutes later, a train came blowing into the station. He boarded the train and found a seat in the back corner of the car. The train left the station and started speeding down the tracks, every few minutes, the announcer would say the name of a station, the train would stop, several people would get out, but more would enter. By the time the "16th street mission" station came, the car was packed with people. The next station, as he could see by the map on the wall of the train, would be Civic Center. His phone was telling him that that was the exit he wanted, so he started making his way towards the door.

As he stood up and walked towards the door, he could see a blonde head bobbing through the crowd at the other end of the car, doing the same. When the doors opened, he was pushed out onto the platform by a small crowd of people disembarking the car, and was almost pulled back in by larger crowd getting in. He looked down the platform towards the door where he had seen the blonde woman, but she was nowhere to be seen. For some reason, this made Cormac anxious, but he couldn't figure out why. He exited the station, and took an elevator to the street level, around him, there were many bustling people, and a large street nearby. He checked his phone and walked off towards the safe house.

The safe house was several blocks away from the BART station, and took him several minutes to make it there. As he away from the major street and down some smaller ones, there were much fewer people. It was late in the day, and it seemed like most people were heading home from work, since a large number of people were heading into the station. The walk took him down near what appeared to be some large government building, and along a side street between two tall buildings. Along this narrow street, there was the familiar metal rolling door with the pin pad. Cormac approached, the door, and looked down the street both ways before entering his pin. He looked down the way he had been heading, and only saw pedestrians walking past, but when he looked the way he had come, he saw someone. It took him a moment, but then he saw that it was the woman from the airport.
