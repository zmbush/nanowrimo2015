# The New Normal

Cormac made a mental list of tasks for the day. Firstly, he would need to head back to Major Corporation Inc. to speak with Mr. Coleman. After that, he assumed that Mr. Coleman wouldn't have any work for him today, he would head to the safe house, and grab some food, and hopefully pick up a new suit. While he had been in training, Mr. Wilson had approached him about joining TSA, the same agency that his father was a member of. At first the boy was reluctant, but as the months passed, he softened on the idea. Having access to the nationwide network of safe houses, storage facilities, and contacts was too good to pass up. The third thing he needed to do that day was to do some research on this woman that was calling herself his mother. There had to be something in the TSA database about her. The previous day, he had managed to pull a few hairs out of her head while he had been holding her down, and was hoping that her DNA was registered with the system. Lastly, he decided, he needed to try to contact Mr. Wilson, or at least someone in the TSA to get his first assignment. If he was going to be a part of this organization, he was going to at least pretend to care about what happened to him.

The boy found his car still parked out on the street in the same place he had left it the previous night. His drive over to MCI was much quicker than his previous walking commute. Not wanting to leave a company car in the parking lot of MCI, he drove the car over to where he knew there was a safe house. He pulled up out front, and keyed in the access code on his dashboard. The rolling metal door sprang to life, and he drove in. He left the keys in the ignition, as was policy when leaving a vehicle at a safe house, and he entered the pin to lock the door behind him. He walked the several blocks over to his former employer to attempt to talk with Mr. Coleman about getting his job back. The place was exactly as he remembered it, the desks were still arranged in the same way, the same boring employees were arranged at the same desks. And there was Mr. Coleman, sitting at his desk right near the front of the office. Cormac was never quite sure why he sat so near the front of the building, the boy had always assumed that it was so he could keep track of when all of his employees were getting in to work every day.

"Cormac!", said the man as he approached, "I heard from your mother that you'd gone missing. Wasn't sure if I'd ever see you again!" "Well, I'm back" replied Cormac. He was never sure how to behave around this man. He was always very nice to him, but the boy could never bring himself to be calm around him. The employer-employee relationship never strayed from the strictest of professional guidelines. The fact that Mr. Coleman had spoken with his mother, or at least the impostor posing as his mother, unnerved him for a reason that he couldn't explain to himself. "My mother told me that I should talk to you about getting my job back", Cormac said, trying to skip the pleasantries. The older man held out a hand, "Of course. You were always one of my most productive employees. Not the most talkative around, but you got your shit done, and I always respected that." Cormac accepted Gene's handshake, "When should I start?", he asked. Mr. Coleman told him to come back the next day, and when Cormac asked if he could have his old desk back, the man looked at him for a moment before telling him that he would make sure that he had his old desk back.

"Thank you, Mr. Coleman", the boy said as he turned from his new boss's desk and headed out the front door. Task one completed. Cormac turned towards the safe house, walked down the street that had been ever so familiar to him a year or so ago. He could still remember every crack and inconsistency in the pavement, but somehow it seemed foreign to him. He didn't really feel at home on this street anymore. He walked passed the place where he had tripped over Wilson. The place where all this bullshit had really started. He could've accepted his MacGuffin going missing, but when the small man turned up, his life took a turn. At the time he was sure it was for the worst, but after his mother was murdered in cold blood, getting trained as an agent seemed like the only logical course of action.

A few minutes later, Cormac found himself back at the safe house where he had stashed the car. He once again keyed in a pin code to open the door, and walked inside. Every agent was assigned a pin code that could be used to access TSA facilities. For higher security applications, a retinal scan was also required, but most safe houses still just used a pin pad. He slipped into the space and closed the metal door behind him. There was a large latch on the inside of the door that swung closed and embedded itself into the concrete floor, holding the door closed much more securely than it looked from the outside. He was standing in a small garage, just large enough for the car that he had parked there earlier in the day. The ceiling was tall, probably about 15 to 20 feet, and the whole space smelled of dust, and slightly of mold. To Cormac's left, there was a door that, he assumed, led to the rest of the safe house. This door had yet another pin pad. He had been forced to remember an algorithm for pin codes during his training. His personal pin was used as one seed to the algorithm, and each pin pad had a code printed on it that would form the other seed. When combined, the resulting pin was unique to that door and that agent.

With a click, the door unlocked, and swung slightly opened. Cormac pulled it the rest of the way open and stepped inside. Within he found that it looked much like a studio apartment that one might rent when just out of college. He knew that there was much more to the space than was immediately visible, but he didn't need any of that at the moment. There was a small kitchen in one corner of the room, with a refrigerator, and a pantry. Since this safe house was not frequently used, there wouldn't be much in the way of perishables, but Cormac knew that he would be able to find some rations stored in the cabinets that would tide him over until he could re-stock the fridge. He would be using this space as the base of his operations for the foreseeable future, and it might as well have some good food. He found the cabinets filled with "Meals, Ready-to-Eat", or as most people called them, MREs. He pulled out the first one on the stack and tore into it. He hadn't eaten since early the previous day, so he didn't feel like checking the label. He regretted that decision, when he realized that this particular meal was a Veggie Burger, but he ate it anyway. Another advantage of being trained to go a long time without food, he had also been trained to eat any food, even if it tasted horrible.

He sat in silence for several minutes as he ate the burger. It was dry, and he didn't bother to warm it up, so it took effort to swallow each bite. He finished the burger, and left the rest of the food on the table, while he looked for the closet. Inside of the closed, he found various different outfits, but no extra suits. He would have to take care of the one he was wearing. He rummaged through the kitchen looking for a cup, he found it and filled it up with water. He sat back down at the table and finished the remainder of the MRE, before taking stock of the rest of the safe house. In a corner opposite the kitchen, there was a small bed, sheets piled on top of it haphazardly. Most of the walls of the room were solid concrete, but up near the ceiling, there was a small window that was casting a thin ray of sunlight into the room. The boy looked up towards the source of the light, he could see blue sky, and the hint of the sun, and... Cormac bolted towards the wall that housed the window. He needed to get out of its sight. His heart pounded loudly in his chest as he looked around the room for a way to close the window.

On a nearby wall there was a small control panel that looked like it controlled various safe house functions, one of which was to close the window. The window above him closed with a snap, and the sound of metal scraping against metal could be heard as a metal shutter covered the window. The room was dark for a few moments before the fluorescent lights in the ceiling flickered to life with that familiar hum that was just ever so slightly painful to listen to. Cormac's heart rate slowly began to return to normal levels. He couldn't see it now, but when he had looked up at the window, he had been sure that there had been a camera pointing in to his safe house. Was this the same people that had killed his mother? The ones that had replaced her with the impostor? Had they taken his MacGuffin? More importantly, how had they known he was there? Nobody was supposed to know that this safe house was even here save for TSA agents. As it turns out, the house was not as safe as Cormac had believed.

Cormac sat for several minutes trying to decide what to do next. He could drive to another safe house, but that was a thirty minute drive at least, and if someone was watching him, he couldn't afford to compromise two safe houses in one day. He reached for the control panel again, pressing a different button than the one he had pushed before. In an instant, all of the lights in the room turned off, and was replaced by a single red light bulb in the center of the room. He could hear clicking and scraping from around the room and inside of the walls. The room was going into lock down, which was standard procedure before activating the TSA computer. There had to be no chance that anyone could compromise the computer system. In the dim red light that filled up the room, Cormac could see hatch roughly the size of a small sedan open up in the middle of the floor, and a hulking metal mainframe computer rose up through the hole. The monitors blazed to life, blinding the boy in the semi darkness.

The sounds that filled the room slowed, and then stopped with a final, loud clunk as everything locked into place. The red light turned off again, and the room was once again illuminated by the fluorescent bulbs. The computer in front of him reminded Cormac of the computer that he had found under his father's study all those months ago, but did not present him with nearly the same amount of dread. He pulled over a chair from the kitchen area, and sat down in front of the computer. The now familiar log in prompt was before him. It was at that point that he realized that he didn't have a cypher. That was the only way to generate a password for him to log in, he had realized several months ago, when Mr. Wilson had introduced the concept of the password cypher, that the MacGuffin that his father had given him had been one such cypher. What Cormac hadn't realized when he was down underneath his father's study was that while the MacGuffin had some information on it, its true nature could only be revealed by someone who knew what they were looking for. When he had finally learned about cyphers and how to use them, he had finally understood precisely how badly he had failed his father's test, and why he had been so upset about it.

He hadn't thought to ask Mr. Wilson for a cypher, because he had had no idea how much longer his training was going to last. The day he had been able to leave had been entirely a surprise to him. He thought back to some of the notes about how various agents had hidden their cyphers. They needed to have it on them at all times, but needed it to not be easily discoverable. Some dedicated agents even went so far as to embed one in their teeth. However, the most common and straightforward way, was to store it in the inner flap of their regulation black tie. Upon closer inspection of the tie he had been given before leaving the facility, Cormac found a small slightly oblong device. The password he generated was partially a secret known only to him that he had chosen months ago, and partly a code that would be generated by the cypher. By combining the something that only he knew, with the something that only he had, he could successfully prove that he was who he said he was.

The computer screens around him filled with information. He inspected the screen that had thermal imaging of the area surrounding the safe house, and started scrubbing through footage of the last few minutes. Maybe, just maybe, he could figure out who had been snooping on him, and give him some kind of lead into what was going on. Even upon looking 30 minutes back in time, he was unable to pick out anything or anyone suspicious around the base, let alone near the back window. Maybe the security camera would be more useful, he thought. To his surprise, however, even though he was looking at the camera that pointed directly at the window of the base, he saw nothing. He could see the window open, and then he could see the window close and the shutter shut. But no camera. He had been so sure that he had seen something. Maybe it's just stress, he decided, he hadn't really slept much since leaving the facility. Perhaps it would make sense to sleep in the safe house during the day so he could be alert at night in case the impostor tried to take him out in his sleep.

With an uneasy feeling filling his stomach, Cormac returned to the main console of the mainframe and sat back down. He sat for a moment before finally deciding to enter in the command to look up a person. A simple looking interface popped up on the screen, and presented him with various text boxes to enter in information like name, maiden name, current or former address, gender, etc. His heart started pounding in his chest as he entered in his first search term: `name: Katherine Leandra Anderson`, `maiden name: Evans`, `Current or former address: 88 Lakewood Parkway, Burlington, Vermont`. He closed his eyes slightly as he pressed enter. Several moments later, he heard the computer beep, almost certainly announcing that it had completed its search. The result page showed only a single result, "Katherine Anderson". The boy clicked through to see what information TSA had on her.

Cormac's eyes rested on the screen, next to the information that was streaming forth about his mother, he saw a photograph of her face. This one must be the one from her driver's license, as she looked several years younger than the boy could remember. She seemed happy in that picture. Well, she looked as happy as anyone really did when they had to get their picture taken at the DMV. More than happy, she really looked exhausted, but that was to be expected. She didn't look anything like the he had remembered her than night, her face had been frozen in a look of complete shock at the what was occurring to her. Someone had cut her wrists, and removed one of her ears, and she bled to death, lying on the bed. He had seen her. He had seen the life drain from her eyes as he stood there. Nothing he had been able to do had been able to save her, and he could never forgive himself for that.

He began to scan down the information on the left side of the screen, perhaps to see if there was any information as to who had killed her.

    Katherine Leandra Anderson (nee Evans)
    Status: Alive
    Age: 57
    Current Address: 88 Lakewood Parkway, Burlington Vermont
    Police reports: None

His eyes rested on the one thing that seemed to laugh in the face of everything he had believed for the past eight months, everything that Mr. Wilson had told him during training. Everything he had come to accept in the long hours of training. His mother, according to the TSA database, was alive. According to one of the most exhaustive databases of humans on earth, living or dead, and it claimed she was alive. The woman that he had seen, dead in a pool of her own blood.
