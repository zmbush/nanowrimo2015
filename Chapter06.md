# Chapter 6: Stuck

As his body calmed down, he started to become more aware of the sounds in the room. He could once again hear his breathing, he could hear his heartbeat in his ears, but he could no longer hear the fan from the computer. He lifted his head to look towards his only chance of rescue, and saw that the screen had turned black.

He pushed himself up onto shaking legs, and stumbled towards the computer. As he approached, he saw, where the keyboard had been sitting, a post-it note. As he got close enough to read it, he found that it was a note written in his father's handwriting. It said:


```
Cormac:

I'm sorry that I am unable to say
goodbye to you or your mother, but
please understand that I was unable to
stay.

The user name of this terminal is
"Condor", and I gave you the password
before I left. To get out of this room,
you can use the command:

           basectl unlock

Please don't come looking for me.

-H
```

What did he mean by "I gave you the password"? Cormac couldn't remember any password. First he'd have to get the computer started up again. He retrieved the keyboard from the ground, part of the heavy plastic had chipped off from the side, but it looked like it would still work. The sound of rolling wheels filled up the room as he pulled the chair back towards the desk. He sat back down and, held his breath, and pressed a few keys on the keyboard. After a few agonizingly slow seconds, the sound of the fan returned, and the screen blinked back to life.

Once again, the screen was black save for a single innocent looking `console login:` taunting him. He entered the user name from the note and sat staring at the `Password:` prompt trying to figure out what password his father had given him. He had vanished several years ago with no warning, and the police were never able to find his body. Apparently, he left of his own volition. Still, Cormac could not think of what the password was. The only thing his father had ever given him was...

The MacGuffin! Cormac could remember that there was something written on it, but he had always assumed that it was just some stupid inspirational quote. "We accept what love we think we deserve" or something like that. Could that somehow be the password? Maybe it's just the phrase? That seemed too long to be a password. He'd heard that some people use the first letters of the words in a quote they liked, so maybe the password was "wawlwtwd"? It was worth a shot. He stared at the keyboard intently as he typed out the letters and pressed enter.

`Login incorrect`. "What the fuck?" he cried out in frustration. Maybe he remembered the quote wrong? He never gave much thought to the quote itself, so he could've forgotten the exact wording. Maybe there was a picture of the MacGuffin on his phone! He always carried it with him, so it may have been in the background of a picture at one point. He pulled out his phone and started swiping through his pictures.

After several minutes of swiping, he finally came upon a picture that had the MacGuffin and the quote in plain view. Ah, it was "the" not "what". Cormac tried this new password, "watlwtwd". The computer seemed surprised, because the screen went blank for several seconds, before the screen displayed `Condor@console #` and sat there with yet another blinking cursor. After referring back to the note, he typed out `basectl unlck` and pressed enter. Instead of unlocking the door like he expected, it print out the following text:

```
Unknown command: 'unlck'

Usage: basectl [command] ...

Commands:
  lights - Turn the lights on or off
  lockdown - Lock the base for the specified number of hours (defaults to 1)
  monitor - Activate assignment monitoring screens
  panels - Open or close the equipment panels
  unlock - Seals ancillary features and opens the exit
```

Cormac looked at the command he had typed in and realized his mistake. His hands typed the command in a second time, but he stopped as he began to read the other commands he could use. His finger moved back and forth between the enter and backspace keys. He was so close to his goal of finally getting out of this room... But what could be in this room that would require a lockdown? And what were the "equipment panels" that it referred to. Exhaustion and hunger got the better of him, however, and his index finger fell down onto the enter key.

A message was printed on the screen in response, but before he was able to read it, the computer console in front of him receded into the wall accompanied by the scraping of wood on concrete. Just after it slid out of view, another piece of concrete slid to cover the hole and shut completely with a satisfying thunk. A scraping noise behind Cormac brought his attention to the direction of the entryway. Finally! The exit he had been vying for was opening up. He slowly stumbled towards the short hallway leading up to the spiral staircase and his freedom.

He hardly noticed as the concrete wall closed again behind him, and the scent of bleach that had so pervaded his senses finally began to fade. The wooden stairs creaked slightly as he made his way up them, and the scent of recently disturbed dust once again filled his nostrils. Cormac looked back down the staircase, but saw only darkness as the lights behind him shut off shortly after he passed. He let out a great sigh of relief as his father's study began to appear around him. Nothing seemed more reassuring than the bookshelf filled with the most boring books imaginable, the ransacked trophy cabinet, the unadorned desk.

As he stepped up onto the smooth hardwood, the spiral staircase morphed smoothly back in line with tho other slats of wood in the floor, leaving almost no visible seam. The carpet swished across the floor as Cormac stepped out of the way. Other than the trophy cabinet, the room looked exactly as he had found it. Exhausted from all he had been through, he could only think about how much he wanted to sleep, and he soon found himself falling face first into his bed.
