# Hot Pockets and Research

As Cormac drove away from his childhood home, he saw the woman that looked so much like his mother fall to her knees crying. Whoever they had hired to take his mother's place was doing some tremendous acting. Unfortunately for her, the boy could see through her facade and felt no pity for her. The pale imitation of the one person in the world he had ever truly loved could never replace the real thing. As soon as she was out of sight, the boy turned his plans to preparing for a long stay at the nearby safe house. He would stop by the supermarket and pick up food, because he did not want to live off of MREs for the next few weeks.

The store was only two blocks away from the safe house, so he drove in that direction, finding a spot in the small parking lot in front of the store. Once inside, he grabbed as much bottled water as he could carry, and several boxes of hot pockets. He didn't have a huge amount of money on hand after he was without a job for eight months. He payed cashier and walked out weighed down with plastic bags full of simple but tasty foodstuffs. He was back at the safe house in a couple minutes, and parked inside. He walked in and dropped his food off in the refrigerator.

Cormac could see that there were a few rays of light still creeping through the small window near the ceiling before he activated the mainframe and began doing some research. He first checked the database to make sure he hadn't imagined the error in his mother's entry. It was still there. `Status: Alive`. Lies. His attention turned to the most intriguing of his targets, Die Faust. He had heard only very little of this man from Mr. Wilson, and he learned very little from the database as most of the information was classified. He did manage to learn that his real name was... Sandra Wilkinson. So that was why almost everyone referred to her only as Die Faust, it would be hard for a woman to hold as much sway in such an organization as the mysterious Faust did.

With any more information about Faust not forthcoming, he turned his focus to the member of the trio that he knew the least about. Stephen Greene. Greene, unlike Faust and his father did not have a code name, and had never been a field operative. Most of his work was focused on managing and enabling the nearly unlimited expense account that was afforded to agents, and he was also the one through whom all of the justifications for expenses flowed. Upon researching about this man, he could remember vaguely that Mr. Wilson had mentioned him, but only occasionally. He had said that Greene was one worth knowing about, but whom he would rarely have direct contact. His status as a glorified accountant, and his apparent lack of agent training made him seem like an ideal first target, thought Cormac.

Finally, he needed to get more information about his father. Holden Anderson had always been something of an enigma to his son. He had been around some when the boy was a child, but as the boy grew up, he was around less and less. The only interaction Cormac could really remember with his father was the few times that he had taken him camping or on other trips that his father called "training", but Cormac had always just thought of as a way for his father to bore him to death. When he had been very young, he had thought that what his dad did was so cool, but as he grew, he saw how hard his father's job was on his mom. He was never around, and would frequently be gone without any communication for months at a time. After his training, Cormac finally understood better why his father was like that, but he still couldn't bring himself to forgive the man.

The database had very few specifics about his father other than his name and code name "The Condor". There was a list of commendations from upper management and a list of successful missions he had been involved in. They were listed by a code name, and all but a few of those missions were accessible by him. Cormac decided that he would really need the access of a higher ranking officer to be able to fully prepare for his assault. So far all he had learned was that Die Faust was a woman, and that Stephen Green was just a schmuck with a desk job. The missions that he could see from his father were mostly pretty boring. Escort missions, protection details, the usual boring tasks an entry level body guard would do. There were some pretty high profile people being protected, but nothing of much interest. Nothing he could use against any of them.

His frustration got the better of him and he shut down the mainframe, only just now realizing how hungry he had become. His stomach rumbled as he waited for his microwave food to heat up, he drained one of the plastic water bottles, and set it down on the counter. He would need to get a water filter at some point if he was going to be staying at the safe house for long, but for now, the water bottles would hold him over. The microwave beeped repeatedly until he took the food out of it. He sat on the bed with the piping hot food next to him. He had put it in the microwave for too long and it was scalding hot. He would need to wait for several minutes before it was going to be cool enough to eat.

He took out his phone and started playing some stupid driving games until he could not wait any longer for the food. It smelled delicious to his nutrient deprived brain, and, luckily, it had cooled down enough to eat without enduring searing pain. For whatever reason, it was the most comforting, delicious food he had tasted in weeks. His mind was still focused on his task, but he could breathe a small sigh of relief and relax for a while. He had been able to get some idea what he would need to get at his targets, and he just needed to wait for Mr. Wilson to come back and help him. Tomorrow would be Monday as well, he would need to go back to his job tomorrow, and he hoped that that would end up being distracting enough for him to wait until the small man returned.

* * *

The next day dawned, and Cormac awoke prepared to return to his job. Even though he was still focused on the task at hand, it had been almost a year since he had last done his menial but simple job, and he had grown to miss it. Sure, it wasn't anything glamorous, but nobody really bothered him there, and he got payed decently. It also seemed like his boss really valued the work that he put in, and that was a nice feeling. He had never really gotten that kind of respect from his father, he had never really wanted to do what his father had wanted for him, and that didn't really help their relationship.

Being only a couple blocks away from his work now was very useful for him. He didn't even bother to drive this morning, enjoying the cold morning air as it flowed across his body. While his mind was still trying to process what he needed to do, he still found the walk to be the most serene he had felt in many months. During training he hadn't had any time to think of anything but whatever he had been taught that day, and since he had left the facility, he had thought of little else other than what to do to the man that had murdered his mother. Now that he had a lead, he knew that it was only a matter of time before he was able to get close enough to them to take them down. If there was anything he had learned from his months of training, it was that patience is a very powerful virtue. Anything can come to one who waits.

The office had changed so little since he had left for his training, and he could see as he walked in the front door, his old seat had been vacated for him. He nodded at Mr. Coleman as he walked to his familiar desk. He looked at the familiar surroundings, the familiar co-workers, the familiar lights in the ceiling. Before him was the familiar in pile of forms to transcribe, and the familiar out pile that would fill up faster than any of the people's around him would. Despite all of his training, this was still where he shone. The one thing that he had ever really been able to take pride in.

His day continued much as he remembered it would, the in pile dwindled, and when he reached about half way through, he took a break for lunch. He had brought with him some hot pockets from the safe house and sat down in the break room as he waited for the microwave to finish. Several people came in and out of the break room, but none of them seemed to acknowledge Cormac, let alone have anything to say to him. This suited him just fine. The microwave beeped signaling its completion of its task. The boy took his food out to his usual bench in the park across the street, and sat down to eat.

He was about half way through the hot pocket, when he heard someone sit down next to him. He looked around and saw that there were many benches around with nobody sitting at them. There was no reason for anyone to sit next to him. He looked at the man that had invaded his peace, and saw that it was the man he had drove around Oakland in his car. Mr. Tripp put out his hand for Cormac. The boy shook it, looking at the man with a confused expression. "What are you doing here?", the boy prodded after waiting for the man to start the conversation. "I think you know, Mr. Anderson. I wanted to check on your progress. I haven't seen you making much effort to deal with our little... Problem", he said the last word so casually, like asking for him to kill three people was commonplace. "I am making progress", the boy told him, not wanting to fully explain his process, "I'm waiting on some information to become available before I act."

Mr. Tripp stood up, and looked off into the distance. He started walking away, and then stopped. He turned his head slightly towards Cormac so that the boy could only see him in profile, and said, "You don't want me as an enemy, Mr. Anderson. I can be a very powerful asset to you. Pray that you do not disappoint me". Cormac could do little more than stare at the man as he walked away, he continued walking down the path for several feet, until the path curved around a tree. The man passed behind the tree, and Cormac did not see him again. The boy looked at his surroundings, and picked out a few people trying pointedly to avoid glancing at him. What had they heard? He hadn't said anything incriminating, so he wasn't sure what they were avoiding his gaze so pointedly for.

The hot pocket in his hand had gotten cold by the time he returned to his food, a slight sense of unease about the whole situation. It had only been a few hours since Mr. Tripp and he had last talked, and the boy was unclear what the man was trying to accomplish by bothering him in the middle of a park in broad daylight. He had gotten involved with some pretty interesting people, about that Cormac was sure. He made a mental note of Mr. Tripp's appearance and any distinguishing features, so he could attempt to look him up in the TSA database. If he could find any more information about the man, Cormac thought, it would be very helpful.

Cormac finished eating his cold and now slightly unappealing lunch and returned to work. He was distracted by the sudden re-appearance of Mr. Tripp, and it slowed down his data entry somewhat. However, he still made good progress and by around 3 p.m. he found himself pulling the last piece of paperwork from his in pile, entering the data, and placing it in his out pile. With nothing left for him to do that day, he closed down his computer, picked up his suit jacket, and left the office. Mr. Coleman nodded at him as he left, and he returned the favor. His boss wasn't such a bad guy, he had given Cormac his job back after all. Maybe when this was all over, Cormac would have to make some friends with the co-workers he had spent his entire career ignoring.

He didn't really have anyone else at this point.
