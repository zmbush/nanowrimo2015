# Hot Pockets and Research

As Cormac drove away from his childhood home, he saw the woman that looked so much like his mother fall to her knees crying. Whoever they had hired to take his mother's place was doing some tremendous acting. Unfortunately for her, the boy could see through her facade and felt no pity for her. The pale imitation of the one person in the world he had ever truly loved could never replace the real thing. As soon as she was out of sight, the boy turned his plans to preparing for a long stay at the nearby safe house. He would stop by the supermarket and pick up food, because he did not want to live off of MREs for the next few weeks.

The store was only two blocks away from the safe house, so he drove in that direction, finding a spot in the small parking lot in front of the store. Once inside, he grabbed as much bottled water as he could carry, and several boxes of hot pockets. He didn't have a huge amount of money on hand after he was without a job for eight months. He payed cashier and walked out weighed down with plastic bags full of simple but tasty foodstuffs. He was back at the safe house in a couple minutes, and parked inside. He walked in and dropped his food off in the refrigerator.

Cormac could see that there were a few rays of light still creeping through the small window near the ceiling before he activated the mainframe and began doing some research. He first checked the database to make sure he hadn't imagined the error in his mother's entry. It was still there. `Status: Alive`. Lies. His attention turned to the most intriguing of his targets, Die Faust. He had heard only very little of this man from Mr. Wilson, and he learned very little from the database as most of the information was classified. He did manage to learn that his real name was... Sandra Wilkinson. So that was why almost everyone referred to her only as Die Faust, it would be hard for a woman to hold as much sway in such an organization as the mysterious Faust did.

With any more information about Faust not forthcoming, he turned his focus to the member of the trio that he knew the least about. Stephen Greene. Greene, unlike Faust and his father did not have a code name, and had never been a field operative. Most of his work was focused on managing and enabling the nearly unlimited expense account that was afforded to agents, and he was also the one through whom all of the justifications for expenses flowed. Upon researching about this man, he could remember vaguely that Mr. Wilson had mentioned him, but only occasionally. He had said that Greene was one worth knowing about, but whom he would rarely have direct contact. His status as a glorified accountant, and his apparent lack of agent training made him seem like an ideal first target, thought Cormac.

Finally, he needed to get more information about his father. Holden Anderson had always been something of an enigma to his son. He had been around some when the boy was a child, but as the boy grew up, he was around less and less. The only interaction Cormac could really remember with his father was the few times that he had taken him camping or on other trips that his father called "training", but Cormac had always just thought of as a way for his father to bore him to death. When he had been very young, he had thought that what his dad did was so cool, but as he grew, he saw how hard his father's job was on his mom. He was never around, and would frequently be gone without any communication for months at a time. After his training, Cormac finally understood better why his father was like that, but he still couldn't bring himself to forgive the man.

The database had very few specifics about his father other than his name and code name "The Condor". There was a list of commendations from upper management and a list of successful missions he had been involved in. They were listed by a code name, and all but a few of those missions were accessible by him. Cormac decided that he would really need the access of a higher ranking officer to be able to fully prepare for his assault. So far all he had learned was that Die Faust was a woman, and that Stephen Green was just a schmuck with a desk job. The missions that he could see from his father were mostly pretty boring. Escort missions, protection details, the usual boring tasks an entry level body guard would do. There were some pretty high profile people being protected, but nothing of much interest. Nothing he could use against any of them.

His frustration got the better of him and he shut down the mainframe, only just now realizing how hungry he had become. His stomach rumbled as he waited for his microwave food to heat up, he drained one of the plastic water bottles, and set it down on the counter. He would need to get a water filter at some point if he was going to be staying at the safe house for long, but for now, the water bottles would hold him over. The microwave beeped repeatedly until he took the food out of it. He sat on the bed with the piping hot food next to him. He had put it in the microwave for too long and it was scalding hot. He would need to wait for several minutes before it was going to be cool enough to eat.

He took out his phone and started playing some stupid driving games until he could not wait any longer for the food. It smelled delicious to his nutrient deprived brain, and, luckily, it had cooled down enough to eat without enduring searing pain. For whatever reason, it was the most comforting, delicious food he had tasted in weeks. His mind was still focused on his task, but he could breathe a small sigh of relief and relax for a while. He had been able to get some idea what he would need to get at his targets, and he just needed to wait for Mr. Wilson to come back and help him. Tomorrow would be Monday as well, he would need to go back to his job tomorrow, and he hoped that that would end up being distracting enough for him to wait until the small man returned.
