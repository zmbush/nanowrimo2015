# Fight or Flight

Cormac continued to creep upwards towards the crouched man in the middle of the records room. It was mostly dark in the room, there was only a small amount of light, and that light was above the crouched man. As he approached, the boy reached into his sock to pull out the plastic knife that he had brought with him. He brought it up as if he was a vampire hunter about to stake a vampire.

He crept behind the stacks of boxes, making his way around the room, ready to leap forward at any moment. He had to be sure that the man before him was indeed the one he was looking for, he did not want any undue casualties. His footsteps sounded incredibly loud as he tried to slip slowly through the shadows. By the time he circled the room enough to get a look at the man, he was already putting the papers back into his box. He stood up, lifting the box with him as he moved to place it on the shelf. From Cormac's perspective it was difficult to get a good look at the man's face.

The man finally places the box on the shelf, and turns away to reach for another one. In that moment, the boy got a good look at the man's face, and he could tell without a shadow of a doubt that this was the man he was looking for. This was Mr. Greene. So prepared to get vengeance for the death of his mother, he moves forward. But he moved too soon. The man looked up when he heard the sound of Cormac approaching. The man threw the box he was carrying towards the boy, and ran out of the room. Cormac only succeeded in embedding his plastic knife into the box of papers.

Papers and folders flew everywhere as the box tumbled to the ground. It took Cormac several moments to realize exactly what had happened. He wheeled around to look towards the door of the room. He could see his quarry for only a moment as the door came slamming closed behind him. The boy began to give chase, but his foot slipped on the pile of papers covering the floor. He fell forward with no ability to stop himself. He thanked his lucky stars that one of the metal shelves wasn't close to his head as it instead collided with the floor. For a moment, the world went black, and Cormac worried that he might pass out, but the sound of shouting voices brought him to. He couldn't stop now.

He pulled himself up and ran towards the door. Through the small glass window, he could see that the hallway, though filled with sound was bereft of any people. Figuring that this would be his only chance, he ran from the room, shutting the door behind him. His only option was to dart into one of the rooms on the side of the hallway. None of them had any sort of label on them that would give any hint as to their contents. They were also some of the few doors in the place that didn't have a window on them, so Cormac's only choice was to guess at random.

He sprinted towards the first door on his left, and tried the knob. It was locked. His heart started beating in his throat, the sound of it mixing with the alarms and shouting. He ran across the hall and pulled feverishly on the next door he could find, but it too wouldn't budge. His last hope was a door to the immediate left of his current door. He reached for the handle, sure that if this one was locked that he would meet his end. With a triumphant tug, he managed to pry the door open, despite its stiff hinges.

The room was dark, and he threw himself inside and shut the door so quickly that he didn't have a chance to check what was inside. Once the door slammed behind him, of course, the room was pitch black, and he could see nothing anywhere. His eyes strained in the darkness trying to discern if there was anywhere in the room he could hide. The sound of footsteps filled the hallway outside the door, but he didn't hear anyone heading for his door. For a moment, at least, he was safe.

He felt around the walls trying to find some kind of switch for a light, but he was unable to find one. He put his hands out in front of him, and felt nothing but air. With this new discovery, he moved slowly forward, flailing his hands around hoping to catch them on something that would reveal what room he was inside of. To his sides, his hands brushed up against what felt like cloth, and it seemed to be hung up on hangers. He had not yet reached the back of the room, still feeling on all sides, when his face collided with a small piece of metal. It seemed to be a small beaded chain hanging from the ceiling, not unlike the kind that would be attached to overhead lights.

The boy tugged on it. If that was somehow going to summon people to him, that would only advance his already inevitable discovery. With a sigh of relief, Cormac found that the lights in the room turned on, and there was no noticeable change in the alarms blaring in the hall. His eyes winced as the new light assaulted them, it was brighter than they had seen for a while, and it took them a while to adjust. When he finally felt safe to re-open his eyes, he looked around the room he had found himself in. The pieces of cloth he had felt were uniforms. They were the simple white uniforms that most of the higher ups wore. The only person Cormac could think of who didn't wear the white uniform was Mr. Greene.

Upon his discovery of this new piece of serendipity, a new plan started to hatch in the boy's brain. His chances of getting another go at Mr. Greene tonight were going to be slim. After seeing a knife wielding agent come flying out of the darkness at you, you were liable to head straight home. Still, if he could take out Ms. Wilkinson, perhaps the whole night wouldn't be a complete bust. With the whole place in an uproar, it seemed entirely likely that nobody would look twice at a higher up briskly strolling down the halls. There were a lot of higher ups, and Cormac figured that they might have a hard time remembering each other. Besides, in the uproar, nobody would be looking too closely.

The boy leafed through the clean white uniforms looking for one that would fit him. He finally found what he was looking for at the back of the closet, and he donned his new disguise. Newly invigorated by his new plan, Cormac was ready to head up to floor 19. He was going to have to be careful, but this new plan seemed bulletproof. He found a mirror in the back of the room, and checked himself in it. He looked like the spitting image of a higher up.

Cormac mused that he had never seen any agents get promoted. They always seemed to bring higher ups from other branches, instead of promoting from within. The boy wondered if that caused any discontent in the ranks. If he hadn't been so new, he probably would be pissed off about it. Nevertheless, he moved towards the exit of the closet. He saw with relief that there was a small keyhole, the old kind that you could still look through, in the door. From his limited vantage point, he could see nobody in the hallway, and he couldn't hear any voices.

Figuring that now was probably better than never, Cormac pushed open the door and walked confidently into the hallway. He didn't see anyone nearby, but just to be extra cautious, he made sure to look straight at the ground and look like he had somewhere to be. In his experience, if you walked fast enough and looked angry enough, nobody would even question where you were going. Someone that focused, must be doing something very important. And Cormac was doing something _very_ important.

Even if he was wearing the outfit of a higher up, Cormac dared not take the elevator up to the 19th floor. Instead, he would have to find the stairwell. He had never taken the stairwell before, but he was fairly certain where it was. Just to be safe, he consulted a map on the wall before continuing in his chosen direction. Yep, this was the way to the stairs. He saw a few people running around looking panicked as he walked determinedly down the hallway. He couldn't help but let a wicked smile grow across his face, as he realized that his ruse was working. Nobody was going to stop him on his way to his goal. Nobody was going to prevent his revenge.

The hallway was longer than Cormac had expected, but he finally reached the door to the stairwell, and walked inside. He was thankful when the door closed. The alarms were blaring out in the hallway, but they weren't making a sound in here. He ran up the stairs two at a time, making sure to look like he was looking for a rogue agent as much as the next guy. The stairway seemed to last forever as fear mixed with excitement caused the adrenaline to spike. Cormac saw red as he bounded up to the top of the stairwell. He found himself facing the door to the 19th floor. This was where Ms. Wilkinson was. This was where Holden was. Cormac was going to reach his goal, and nobody was going to be able to stop him. He reached for the door handle and pulled the door open, once again assaulted by the blaring alarms.
