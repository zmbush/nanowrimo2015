# Chapter 1: The incident

The fall air comes rushing through Cormac's open window. Ripples of air play across his face and
make it very difficult for him to continue sleeping. Sleeping is one of the few things he enjoy
these days.  He think back to last night, and to the endless stream of netflix and popcorn. He can't
recall leaving his window open. He never leaves it open this time of year, it always gets too cold
at night. Why would He have left it open? He can't remember.

He opens his eyes and begins to stand up to close the window, when his foot begins to experience
extreme pain. He jerks his foot back and falls back against the bed. Upon close inspection, he
realizes that a rather large chunk of glass has embedded itself in the arch of his foot. By this
time his eyes have cleared up enough such that he is able to see the floor of his room, littered
with glass and his possessions.

He props himself up against the wall of his bedroom and starts to hop his way towards his bathroom.
He makes it with little incident, and he manages to contort his leg such that his foot is sitting in
the sink. He begins to run the water over the wound as he fumbles in the medicine cabinet for some
tweezers and bandages. He finds the box of gauze, and places it on the counter. He can't find the
tweezers, but decides to pull it out by hand. It's not very deep, but it still hurts like a bitch as
he pulls it gingerly out of his foot. The blood starts to flow as the chunk of glass clatters in the
bottom of the porcelain basin.

"Shit, where's my towel?".

The wound is bleeding more than he had expected. He fumbles behind him for his towel, but as he
leans backwards, his awkward position gives way as his good foot slips and he tumbles down to the
cold tile. He cries out in pain as his head slams against the wall and he slumps down. So much for
not getting blood everywhere, the red water from the sink splashed everywhere. He reaches up and
grabs his towel and wraps his aching foot.

He pulls himself up and turns off the water. He rests gingerly on the toes of his left foot and
reaches for the box of gauze to wrap his foot. Empty.

"Mom!?", he shouts to no reply.
