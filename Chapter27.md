# Waking Up

Cormac looked at him, narrowing his eyes. 'Sure', he thought, 'help me like you helped me forget that my mother had been killed'. The small man continued, "Mr. Anderson, we only want what's best for you. However, after your outburst from the other day, there may be little we can still do for you. If your behavior continues to degrade as it has done, we may be forced to put you into criminal population, and almost nobody comes back from that". The boy wanted to interrupt the man, but couldn't think of anything to say. His eyes were still watering, and he looked into the smiling face of a man that had presumably strapped him to a table.

"If you promise to behave, Cormac, I can remove your straps. Keep in mind, though, any sudden movements, and Frank and Jeremy here may be forced to restrain you. Can you behave?", his voice was filled with a kind of horrible condescension, as he continued to look down at Cormac. He nodded, and that seemed to satisfy the small man. He motioned to his large associates, and they moved forward and began undoing the straps that were holding Cormac down. As the pressure on his head and chin loosened, he could feel some of his panic abating. He felt like he at least had a fighting chance now, were something to happen. Once the straps on his hands and legs were removed, the large men lifted him up into a sitting position, looking straight at the small man in front of him.

"There, that's better, right Cormac?", Mr. Wilson looked at him, still smiling placidly. "Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I want you to answer me as honestly as you can, okay?" Cormac nodded again, feeling anxious about what was coming. "Okay. Let's begin. What is your name?". Cormac answered him, "Cormac Anderson". "Good, now let's try something a bit more substantive. Where is your father?" "I... I don't know. I think he's dead. Or at least...", Cormac stopped when he realized that he was about to say "that's what he told me", but that would have sounded crazy. He instead finished with, "that's what I've been told".

Mr. Wilson brought out a small notebook and began scratching down something that Cormac could not see. He looked up at Cormac, and continued, "Okay, do you know where your mother is?" This seemed like a simple question, and if he had been asked that a few hours ago, the boy was certain that he would have said that she was dead, and that she had been murdered. But now he wasn't so sure. He could still remember seeing her dead on her bed, but the memory was fuzzy, like a dream. "I... Don't remember", he finally had to say, not wanting to admit that he thought she was dead if she really wasn't.

More notes were scratched down, and the man looked up at him again, his face was difficult to read. "Okay, that's alright. Now Cormac, one last question. Do you know where you are?" Cormac blinked at him. Of course he knew where he... Well, he thought he knew where he was. If his memory was accurate, he was at the headquarters of The Spy Agency, an international espionage organization that was apparently at odds with the US government, but somehow, that seemed wrong. Cormac looked around the room they were in, as if seeing it for the first time.

The walls were white, but they were not solid drywall like he had thought when he had first looked at them. They were padded, as was the floor. The door on the opposite wall had only a small round window, with glass that looked to be about an inch thick. Above him there was a high ceiling, and a single light bulb hanging a few feet from it. Cormac finally opened his mouth, and had to respond, "I don't know". The man looked disappointed.

"Well", the small man started, before pausing to take a few more notes in his notebook. He flipped the cover closed and stuck it back in his pocket. He placed elbows on his knees and leaned forward. "Cormac, you are currently inside the Brattleboro Retreat", he said this as if the boy would immediately recognize the name, but he only stared blankly. "Brattleboro Retreat, Cormac, is a mental health hospital". "Mental health?", Cormac replied, "You mean an insane asylum? But that would mean that... That I... I'm not... What am I doing here?".

The small man sighed. He ran his hand through his hair and looked directly at Cormac. "You don't remember?". Cormac tried. He stared at the man in front of him, he stared at his hands, he stared at the walls around him, but he could not recall. He shook his head, his shoulders slumping. Mr. Wilson sighed again. He took a deep breath, and began to explain.

He told Cormac that he had been stationed in a part of Iraq during a bloody conflict, that he had very narrowly escaped death, and had been found clutching to the body of one of his dead comrades. He told Cormac that while he had been away, his father had fallen very ill, and had been diagnosed with an advanced stage of pancreatic cancer. His family had not wanted to put undue stress on the boy, so they opted for not telling him immediately. As his father's condition worsened, it soon became clear that their son was never going to see his father again. He told Cormac about a video that his father had filmed for him, the video that the boy had watched the previous day.

Cormac's eyes watered, and tears began running down his face again. He wiped them away, and continued to listen, as the small man kept explaining. He spoke about when Cormac returned from his tour, that he had been changed, that he was different. When he had come home, he had been extremely angry and had blamed his mother for his father's death. Soon he began to deny that his father had died altogether, and began hating his father for what he saw as "abandoning him". His mother had become extremely concerned for him, and when she one day found the boy passed out and shaking on the floor of his father's study, she checked him into a psychiatric clinic near his house.

After several months there, it had seemed like he was improving, but when he got out, he became convinced that his mother had been replaced by an impostor. His mother became frightened of him, and at one point he attacked her, tackling her to the ground. After that he was admitted to the Brattleboro Retreat, and began more intensive treatment. He had again been making marked improvement, and the doctors were beginning to believe that he was just about out of the woods when the events of the previous night had occurred. Ms. Wilkinson had shown Cormac the tape as a last ditch effort to attempt to calm him down, and was at least partially successful.

Mr. Wilson looked very seriously at Cormac as he finished his explanation by telling the boy that the board of the hospital wanted them to declare him criminally insane and commit him to an even more intensive treatment, but Ms. Wilkinson had convinced them to give him one last chance. The small man told Cormac that he would need to demonstrate that he was no longer harboring delusions of being a secret agent, or that his father was still alive.

Cormac stared at the man. There was a long pause during which the man continued to observe the boy, and occasionally write down a note in his notebook. After another pause that seemed to last for an eternity, Cormac finally spoke, "I... I can remember thinking I was a spy". Mr. Wilson jotted down another note. Cormac looked around the room. Mr. Wilson took another note. The boy stared at his notebook, suddenly suspicious. He realized with a jolt that if he had been captured by the enemy, they would very much like to convince him that he was insane. It would be so much easier for them if they could just convince him that he was in an insane asylum, and have him tell them everything he knew about TSA.

His eyes narrowed as stared at the small man, he had been so sure that Mr. Wilson was the only person he could trust in this world, that he was the only person in this corrupt organization that was trustworthy. Finally, Cormac's eyes were opened. Mr. Wilson was no more his comrade than any of the other snakes in the organization that he had become a part of. And he would do whatever he needed to do to get what he wanted. His mother had been killed by these people, how could he trust any of them. "I know what happened last night", he finally said, with an air of complete finality.

Mr. Wilson's face sank, his shoulders drooped. He leaned forward, placing his hand on his face, and with his other hand, he gestured at his large comrades. The began to move towards Cormac. He could see that this would be his only chance, and with the speed that could only be fuelled by the most adrenaline powered fugue, he leapt forward, reaching for Mr. Wilson's neck. His hands closed around the small man's neck, and the two of them toppled to the floor. The small man's eyes bulged, and intense fear blotted his usually calm face.

His hands gestured wildly, and Cormac could feel the pressure of the small man's two bodyguards as they attempted to pull him off. His hands were grasped so tightly around the man's neck. If he was going down, he was going to take this fucking midget with him. One of the bodyguards began tugging at Cormac's arms, and the other tried to pull him away from the small man. The small man's hands began moving slower and more clumsily, and Cormac began to fill with excitement at the prospect of achieving his goal.

The small man's eyes closed slowly, and at the same time, Cormac saw stars. His face plunged forward and smashed into the linoleum beneath him. His hands still locked around the small man's neck, as the larger of the two men laid on top of Cormac and the other continued to pry his hands away. Cormac felt another smashing pain meet his skull, and he fell down again, this time, he was no longer able to maintain his grasp. The bodyguard remained sitting on top of the boy, and the other dragged Mr. Wilson from the room, shouting out into the hallway for help.

The door closed behind him, and the bodyguard lifted him from the floor, and slammed him down onto the bed. He pulled out a syringe from his pocket and inserted it into Cormac's neck. As the world around the boy faded, he felt the straps on his arms and legs being tightened, and could faintly hear the sounds of shouting voices and blaring alarms.
