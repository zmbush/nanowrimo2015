# Phoenix Rise

Cormac stood there in the clearing, holding the small piece of paper. He couldn't be sure, but he convinced himself that it was a note from Mr. Wilson. The boy felt confused, and mildly sad that the small man wasn't there to congratulate him. His only human interaction for the last several months had been Earl, taking him to and from his training sessions. The boy leaned against the ATV and couldn't quite figure out what he was supposed to be doing. He could remember that there had been a reason why he had started the training, but for the life of him he couldn't remember what. The only reasonable thing left for him to do, he decided, was to follow the gravel path as far as it would lead him. He mounted the vehicle that had been left for him, donned the helmet, and turned towards the exit of the clearing.

The newly trained agent gunned his ATV and the engine roared to life. Gravel flew backwards out into the woods as his back tires slid back and forth. With a start, the vehicle shot forward at top speed down the sliding grey path. Wind whipped his face like nothing had for months, and the woods became a green and brown blur. The suit coat he was wearing blew out behind him and his tie whipped through the air. The road was slippery and on every turn he made he was forced into a dangerous power slide. Nothing around him was as clear as the single point ahead of him along the gravel path. His focus was so complete, that he hardly noticed as he came hurtling out of the trees and into a wide open field. Ahead of him he saw that the gravel path was about to tee into a two lane highway. His immediate reaction was to enter into yet another slide in order to come to a stop before he reached the lip of the road.

Once he had slowed down to a reasonable speed, he pulled out onto the street heading east. He still wasn't clear where he needed to go, but this seemed like the right direction. The road was rough riding on the ATVs off-road tires, but as he got up to speed, the rough ride became a continuous vibration that filled his entire body. He began again to focus completely on the road ahead as he drove on. As he continued, he continued to try to figure out exactly what he was supposed to be doing, and began to recall that there was a facility ahead from which he could get a vehicle more fit for the road. Roughly 30 minutes later, he reached a large, nondescript building out in the middle of nowhere. As he approached, a large metal door rolled upwards to reveal a black CAR MAKE inside of which, Cormac was sure, was a set of keys.

Once he was back on the road, he continued at high speed towards the city that he was now sure was his goal. He was only dimly aware that this was the city he had been living in all those months ago, when Mr. Wilson saved him from the hospital and brought him to the training facility. Back in those days, he wasn't even sure who he was. He realized now that the Cormac of all those months ago had no purpose. No drive. The drive continued uneventfully for several hours, with rarely another car in sight, and with the fields of the American mid-west flying by, Cormac made his way home.

A small man knocked on his office door, interrupting Holden's deep thought. He always made it a point to meditate at least once a day, the act, much like his office, always brought him back to center and reminded him what he was working for. "Come in" came the elder Anderson's reply. The heavy door slid open, brushing against the carpet, but otherwise making no sound. The obsessively greased hinges made no noticeable sound. When Earl Wilson walked into Holden's office, he was only mildly surprised. He hadn't seen the man in several months, and he had heard no updates on his son's progress. He had assumed that the small man had saved him the trouble of making sure that he would never be able to cross him again, but it would seem that he had no such luck. "Anderson, I take it that my son has been fully trained. Otherwise, I'm going to have to make sure that we will never breathe the same air again" he said with narrowing eyes. "I have, Condor, he just finished last night" the small man said with a slight smirk on his face. "I am sure that he's heading back to his hometown as we speak".

"Why have I heard no updates this whole time?" the elder Anderson interrogated, filling with fresh rage. "I was giving him intensive training. We were out of all communication, but he is now a perfectly competent agent of TSA, and will serve well. He make you proud when next you see him. Holden's face softened, a slight smile moving across his formerly rage filled demeanour. "That's good. I hope to see him soon." he finally said, before a slight look of concern played across his face. "How did you convince him to take the training? You told me that he had refused all attempts to convince him to train. What changed his mind?" "Let's just say, I found something to motivate him", the small man said slyly. "What motivated him." queried Holden, concern replaced once again with anger. The small man cowered now underneath the reproachful gaze of the most intimidating man he had ever met. "I... I showed him a vision". "You what? Our agency could get in a lot of trouble if anyone found out that we used that. And on a civilian no less. You know that stuff was deemed a war crime, right?" "I do, but I'm afraid you gave me no choice" the small man replied, all trace of humor gone from his voice.

Holden stared him down, waiting for Mr. Wilson to offer up any more details as to what vision he had shown his son. The powerful drug could show someone just about anything with the smallest provocation. When they had been testing it back in the sixties, the had managed to convince a man that his wife had been murdered by showing him a department store dummy with a bit of ketchup splashed on it. He had been so convinced that his wife had been murdered, that even when we revealed to him that she was still alive, he could never quite accept that it was her. They had gotten divorced two months later after the man had tried to stab her with a knife to prove to her that she was really a ghost. "Nothing that you need to worry about", was Mr. Wilson's reply, "he won't remember that now, I made sure of it as part of his training". Holden turned to look at the man, a new kind of respect for the sniveling shit filling his mind. "Jesus, man, memory modification to? My son better be none the worse for wear after that kind of treatment. I swear, if he is some kind of vegetable next week, I will kill you."

Mr. Wilson let out a nervous laugh, and assured The Condor that his son was fine, and that he was on his way home. He assured the other man that the only thing that remained from the drugs Cormac had been given was the subconscious desire to return back to his hometown. In fact, the small man continued, there was a small tracking chip in his suit, and they could see that he was on his way home in a company car. "He won't even remember that he saw his mother die", added the small man with a triumphant kind of look on his face. When he looked towards Holden again, he could tell that he had made a dramatic misjudgement in Holden's character. "Get out", the elder Anderson nearly yelled, fuming, "and never go near me or my son again". As if to drive home his point, he pulled out his company issued pistol from his desk drawer and pointed it, with a steady hand, at Earl Wilson's skull.

The small man backed away slowly and fumbled for the door handle behind him. The door opened once again, and he slipped out. Holden sat back down in his chair, and returned his gun to its place. He breathed out, relaxed, and began meditating again.

The boy reached his hometown shortly before nightfall the next day. He had driven nearly nonstop since he left the facility, and had only stopped for food, and occasional rest stops. He was driven by something he didn't quite understand to return home. There was something that he desperately needed to deal with back at home, but he couldn't put his finger on what it was. When he finally reached the front door of the home he had lived in for his entire life, it felt strange, like there was something missing. His unease continued as he entered the house, and walked upstairs to his room. The room appeared very much the same as it had before he left. It was cleaner than he remembered it, but other than that, everything was where he expected it to be. His MacGuffin was still missing. Was that the thing he needed to deal with? It was definitely something he wanted to get back, if only to remember his desire to be entirely unlike his father. He laughed slightly under his breath. "I guess I failed at that" he said to no one in particular. Inside of his bathroom, he saw the reflection of the person he had become. The Cormac of all those months ago wouldn't even recognize him.

On his drive over, he had stopped in several gas stations, and found that roughly eight months had passed since the last time he could remember being in his home town. His training, he had realized then, had almost certainly lost him his job. He was still trying to decide if the MacGuffin was the thing he had been so keen on looking for. He couldn't come up with any other idea as to what had been his motivation for starting his training, so he decided that the MacGuffin must've been his motivation. It seemed only natural that something being stolen from him would lead him to undergo training to try to get it back.

With that issue firmly sorted out, he began to investigate his room. All of the evidence from the break in was gone now, it had been almost a year since that fall day when the only thing his father had ever given him had been taken. It seemed like a lifetime ago. Without any evidence, or anything else to go on, Cormac felt strangely lost. Perhaps the MacGuffin hadn't been his motivation? That didn't seem right, it felt so... Motivating. Nothing, however could change the fact that there was no concrete clues to go off of. The only thing in the room that still remained from the incident was the plastic bag over his window. Somewhere in the back of his head, he was surprised that the window hadn't gotten fixed in his absence, but when he thought about it, he couldn't figure out why anything should have changed. After all, he lived alone.
