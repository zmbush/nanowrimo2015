# To Meet the Father

Cormac sat at the computer dumbstruck. He had been so certain in what he had seen, and yet here before him was evidence that what he had seen had not been real. Cormac tried to think what could have caused him to believe that his mother was dead, but every time he thought about it, all he could see was the image of his mother on her bed. After several more minutes, it slowly dawned on the boy. He was certain that his mother had been killed, that the woman that was living in his house was an impostor, and that the database in front of him was supposed to be exhaustive and extremely accurate. The only logical explanation for this dissonance, was that someone at TSA had faked the record of her death. Someone within his organization had killed his mother, replaced her with an impostor, and then deleted all traces of her death.

The implications of this realization hit Cormac like a ton of bricks. The organization that now employed him had within its ranks a traitor. Why would someone want to kill his mother? He thought about this and was not able to come up with a satisfactory reason. The only possible reason he could come up with was that someone was trying to get to his father. But if that was the case, why would they try to cover it up? No, this had something to do with Cormac, he was sure of it. Whoever was doing this must also be the person that had stolen his MacGuffin. They stole the cypher that his father had given him, and then murdered his mother. They must've realized that he had been training to become an agent and assumed that he would most likely join their ranks, so they had to cover it up. The only person that Cormac could be sure to trust at this point was Mr. Wilson, he had done everything he could to help Cormac get to the point where he would be able to go looking for his mother's killers. He would have to figure out how to contact him without alerting anyone from the agency.

He pulled up the company registry, where every agent's rank, codename, and assignment was listed, and entered in the information for Earl "Storm Crow" Wilson. According to the TSA database, Mr. Wilson was out on assignment somewhere in northern California, but no other details were listed. He may be able to get some information from his father, Cormac realized, so he also looked up his father, and found that he was not out on assignment, and he would be able to find him in TSA headquarters, a nondescript office building in downtown Albany, New York. It was roughly a 3 hour drive away, so he would be able to get there by this evening. Heading to HQ would also fit in well with his plan to get what his first assignment would be, so he decided that he would leave within the hour. He grabbed another MRE in case he got hungry on the way down, and then he returned to the control panel on the wall. He pressed a button, and the mainframe began to sink down into the floor, A metal and hardwood panel slid out to cover the hole, and little evidence of the panel remained visible. The shutters of the window opened again, and the room was filled with natural light, albeit dim light. Cormac realized that he had spent a good part of the day at the safe house and that it was heading quickly into evening. He would have to leave soon if he was going to reach HQ by sundown.

He walked out the door into the small garage where he had left his car earlier that day, and heard the door lock behind him as he closed it. The car was still there exactly as he had left it. The garage was narrow, so he had to squeeze himself into the car to avoid hitting the door against the side. Once inside, he turned the keys in the ignition and the engine roared to life. He keyed in the code to open the garage door, and it blazed to life. The latch that had been sent deep into the concrete lifted up with a horrible screeching sound. The door the rumbled upwards, all the while making the same scraping and screeching sounds. With the door open just wide enough for his car to leave, he drove forward and out onto the street. The door immediately closed again behind him and he could hear the screeching of the giant metal latch as the door settled into place. Cormac keyed his destination into the car's on board navigation and headed off towards New York. Before the events of the last year, Cormac had only visited New York state a handful of times. It was close enough to be a semi-reasonable day trip, but just far enough to be inconvenient.

The light in the sky slowly dimmed as the sun dropped below the horizon. Cormac had been driving for two and a half hours at this point, and was starting to get drowsy. He hadn't really slept the previous night, and he had forgotten to take a nap while he had been at the safe house. He cursed himself for being so eager to figure out what was going on that he had forgotten to even grab some coffee or an energy drink. He hadn't seen a gas station for several miles, and he wasn't sure how much longer he would have to go to find one, so he decided that he could wait until tomorrow to get to headquarters. He modified his destination on his car to find the nearest truck stop, so he could take a nap. The nearest one was still a half an hour away, so he decided that he should just continue on to his original destination. He continued to struggle to keep his eyes open as the last beams of sunlight fled from the sky. By the time he reached headquarters, it was pitch dark outside, and rather than try to meet his father in the middle of the night, Cormac decided that he needed to get some sleep to fortify himself for what was sure to not be a particularly pleasant encounter.

He pulled into the parking garage below the building and parked near the back. The rumble of the car faded as he turned the car off, and he was left with only the illumination from the various dull yellow lamps that were illuminating the underground structure. He leaned his seat backwards and moved a sun shade to block one of the lamps from shining directly into his eyes. He closed his eyes and before he could count to ten, he was asleep. He didn't feel the need to sleep with one eye open this night. Being underneath the headquarters of one of the most powerful spy agencies in the world made him feel quite safe.

When Cormac awoke, the world looked no different than it had the night before. The only light around him was still the dim yellow glow. It seemed that daylight had no chance to filter this far deep into the parking structure, which Cormac was grateful for. He hadn't had a really good night's rest since he left the facility, and needed a good long sleep. He checked tho clock to find that he had slept until almost noon the next day. He was, however certain that he would be able to meet his father there, assuming he hadn't been sent on an assignment since last night. He had learned from Mr. Wilson that the access to many TSA bases were heavily obscured, and that the main headquarters entrance was one of the most difficult to find. If one was to attempt to enter from the street level, they would be greeted with a charming little coffee shop, with no other exits. There was only one other door on the ground floor of this building, however, this door was also only for show. If one was to open it, one would find only a short stairwell that goes up two floors and then disappears into a cement ceiling. The only way to get into the upper floors of this building was to go through the elevator in the parking garage.

On the second floor of the garage, there is what appears to be an access door for maintenance people. Behind it, there was a small metal cabinet, and inside that, there was a keypad. Cormac entered on this keypad his pin code. The metal cabinet slid down into the floor to reveal a small room, just large enough for a single person to enter. The boy stepped in and once the metal cabinet slid back into place, he was greeted with a fingerprint and retina scanners and another pin pad. Once all of these were entered, another door opened in the small room, to reveal what looked like a freight elevator. On one of the walls of the elevator, there was a row of buttons, numbered B6-B1 and 1-16. This was another thing that Mr. Wilson had warned him about, to access the floor he wanted, he must first enter yet another pin code before entering the floor number. If he failed to do that, the elevator would take him to a fake office on the third floor. The office was there to show to the people that owned the building as well as city inspectors. Nobody other than a TSA agent was ever allowed on any floor other than the third.

Cormac followed Mr. Wilson's instructions and soon the elevator was rising all the way up to the sixteenth floor, where he knew his father's office was to be found. He reached the top and was greeted with the familiar bing that told him that he had reached the correct floor. The boy stepped out and walked down the hall looking for his father's office. The hallway large enough to march an elephant through. The gray carpet was immaculate, and the plain white walls were broken up only by doors with the code names of agents on them. The higher ranking the agent, the higher floor they were on, and his father was one of the best. Cormac steeled himself for a confrontation with the man who, until a year ago, he had believed dead. Even though he had been told his father was still alive almost a year ago, he still had not forgiven the man, nor had he fully accepted that his father was indeed alive.

Near the end of the hall, the boy found a door labeled "Condor", he could see from the lighting inside that there was someone moving around inside. He took a deep breath and knocked on the door. "Enter" came a voice that he had not heard in years, a voice he never had expected to hear again. The voice of his father was as curt, insistent, and judgemental as he had remembered it. This was the man that had filled his childhood not with play dates and fun, but with discipline and training. All of which, his father had claimed, was so that Cormac could take over for his father and "run the family business". The boy had never expected that he would be right. He turned the handle, and walked inside.
