# Chapter 8:

Cormac awoke the next day completely convinced that the ordeal he had been through the previous night had been entirely fabricated by his sleeping mind. In fact, he wasn't sure that anything that had happened the previous day had even happened. That is, until he opened his eyes, and saw the black plastic taped over what was once his window. He sat up in his bed and as he placed his feet on the ground, he found that the arch of his foot was still hurting when he pressed down on it. And finally, he looked over at his side table, where every morning for the past 3 years he had been able to see the MacGuffin, and saw that it was empty.

He looked around his room and finally began to accept that the events of yesterday had indeed occurred. He berated himself for neglecting to call the police or do much of anything to attempt to get back what was stolen from him, but he had been so convinced that nobody would want to steal something like that, so he had assumed that he would find it later that day. Now that he had already cleaned his room, and a full day had passed, he accepted that there was nothing he could do to find the perpetrator.

Stepping gingerly on his still injured foot, Cormac went about his usual routine for getting ready for work. He greeted his mother on the way out the door, and went to work. His schedule returned, more or less, to normal.

It had been several weeks since the incident that had lost him his MacGuffin, and Cormac's life had returned to it's usual routine. Most days consisted of him waking up at his usual time, heading off to work, returning home, watching Netflix, and returning to sleep. Despite the traumatic incident in the cement room those weeks ago, Cormac had given very little thought to what had occurred. He never really gave much thought to anything, and this was no different. It was just so much easier to go about his life without thinking about the consequences of anything.

One day in late November, while his car was in the shop, Cormac was walking home from the office. He frequently walked with his head down, either staring at the lines in the concrete, or else looking at his phone. The streets always seemed infinitely more familiar when he was following them by the cracks in the sidewalk. Trees lifted sections of the walkway up, and the city had attempted to deal with the problem by patching it up with asphalt. The effect was that of a constantly sloping, tilting, treacherous path. Cormac could tell by the particular shape of the cracks in the sidewalk that he was about to walk out across Ellis street, so he began to look up from the ground to check for traffic.

His head turned to the right and before he realized what was happening, he walked right into a mailbox that was placed on the side of the road. The mailbox fell over, and Cormac landed right on top of it. He looked down to see that it was not a mailbox at all, but a small man in a black suit, sunglasses, and a fedora. "The fuck, kid! Watch where you're going!" said the small man through the effort of pushing Cormac off of him. He was surprisingly strong for his size.

Cormac couldn't bring himself to look at the tiny man, so he looked to the left and started to cross the street. He was halfway across the street, when he looked back to check on the person he had run over. Cormac expected the small man to walk away, but soon realized that they were crossing the same street. The continued in the same direction, with the small man tailing a few feet behind Cormac for several blocks. It wasn't long before the boy came to the conclusion that the small man was following him. Using his long legs to his advantage, Cormac picked up his pace to try to outstrip his unwanted follower.

Several more blocks, and the small man, though several feet behind Cormac, was still keeping pace. The boy broke into a sprint and darted down an alleyway. He was almost certain that he had lost his tail, but he continued to turn left and right down streets and alleyways. He finally slowed down a bit as he neared his home when he heard footsteps behind him. "I can do this all day, Cormac" came a voice from behind him. The boy froze, panting from his escape attempt, and turned to face whoever had addressed him. "What?" was all he could think to say. "I said, 'I can do this all day'" and with a slight smile, he added "Cormac".

"How do you know my name?" he inquired as he took a step backwards. "I was sent here for you" came the small man's reply. "Sent for me? What did I do?" The small man lets out a slight chuckle, then a short laugh, then breaks down in raucous laughter. "What did I do?" mocked the small man through gasping breath. "Oh, I'm so damn clueless" he continued "Can't even shake a tailing midget!" He continued laughing for several minutes. Every time Cormac took a step backwards to get away from him, the small man moved forwards to follow him.

The small man's face went from mirth to deadly serious faster than the boy thought possible. "Your father sent me" he finally answered. "He was watching you. Saw you fuck up the test. Best damn agent we got, and his shithead of a son can't even figure out the damn qualifying test." "What test?" an incredulous Cormac replied. He wasn't sure if he should be confused or angry, as he looked down at the little man mocking him. "The chamber, remember? Your memory can't be that bad, it was only like a month ago!"

"I thought that was just a dream" replied Cormac before he could stop himself. He could remember his panic at the prospect of dying in that concrete death trap beneath his father's study. He paused for a moment before he continued "how was that a test? I thought it was just some fucking bomb shelter or something". The short man looked genuinely shocked at his response. How had this little shit not even realized what was going on, didn't The Condor give him some training when he was younger? "That wasn't a damn bomb shelter, it was a testing chamber. Usually we have them installed under libraries and things like that, but your father was so sure that you were going to be this great prodigy that he had one built underneath his fucking house."

"My father's dead", Cormac finally intoned to the midget, he was sure of that. He had finally accepted that after he hadn't returned from his "short trip" for 3 years. And there was nothing this little asshole was going to tell him that would change his mind. However he heard about the bomb shelter or what his name was, he didn't care anymore. He just wanted to get as far away from him as possible. He started walking back towards his house again, but this time the small man didn't follow him. He kept checking behind his shoulder to see if he would start tailing him again, but he didn't. Cormac looked back at the small man one last time as he rounded the corner and, content that he was no longer being followed, continued straight home.

He had managed to run pretty far out of his way in his mad dash to get away from the pursuing midget, so it took him an extra fifteen minutes to make it back to the house he shared with his mother. He unlocked and opened the front door of the house and he was greeted by the sounds of his mother having what sounded like a jovial conversation with an old friend. His mom almost never had friends visit, especially after his father had left. A familiar voice drifted in from the kitchen as Cormac removed his shoes. "It feels like I haven't seen you in years Kathy, how's Cormac been doing?" It sounded like... Cormac bolted to the kitchen only to see his mom sitting across from the midget that had followed him earlier.

His mom turned to look at him "Cormac! What took you so long, I made dinner an hour ago." The midget cleared his throat. "Where are my manners, Cormac, this is Mr. Wilson." "You can call me Earl" said the small man as he stood up on the chair and held out his hand to shake Cormac's hand.The boy reluctantly reached out to briefly shake the stranger's hand. "Mr. Wilson used to work with your father. They were close friends for a long time." "I never heard him mention you" noted Cormac curtly. The midget noted his tone, and was not amused.

"I actually came over to have a chat with your son, Kathy. Do you mind if I have a few minutes alone with him?", Mr. Wilson asked as he turned his attention to Cormac's mother. "Not at all, I'll be just down the hall if you need me", and before the boy could say anything to protest, his mother was down the hall in her bedroom, and he was left alone with the small man. Mr. Wilson began to explain to the boy the circumstances of why he had been sent here. "Your father called in a few favors, got them to reconsider you for another test. He is sure that you'll be a great asset to the company, but the leadership is not convinced." He continued to explain that his father had sent him here to help train the boy to pass the entrance exam, and fulfill his destiny.

Cormac sat there listening to this tiny man explain how his dead father was some kind of respected super spy, that he was on some kind of secret mission, and that even though he wanted to return home, he was unable to for some reason. The boy looked at Mr. Wilson with a distant expression, and his eyes glazed over as the man continued to explain his presence. Cormac started leaning back in his chair and staring at the ceiling. He had been binge watching old episodes of the X-Files and really wanted to get back to that. He was starting to wonder what would happen in the next episode when he felt a sharp pain against his face. The boy saw stars, tipped sideways in his chair, and slammed onto the ground.
