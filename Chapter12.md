# Chapter 12: To Be a Spy

A fluttering sound began to sound out from behind him, and he turned to see that the wall in front of him was indeed being used to project a video of some sort. The video in front of him appeared to have been filmed some time ago, and the audio quality was rather poor. It became apparent to Cormac, that the help the small man had offered him to help him find his mother's killer, was the same training that he had been trying to convince the boy to partake in for the majority of the last few months. Fueled by the anger at whoever had done that to his mother, he gritted his teeth and began to follow along with the video as it began to explain the proper way to survive when stranded in the wilderness. The demeanor and explanation was so similar to his father's that Cormac couldn't avoid thinking back on Holden's frequent obsessive training. The only difference now, was that Cormac had a reason to listen.

Cormac sat down in front of the table in the center of the room and watched the video as it explained how to turn a stick and some leaves into a makeshift shelter. The boy had a difficult time accepting that this was any sort of meaningful training, but accepted it anyway because, as the small man kept telling him, that was the only way he was going to find his mother's killer. His mother had been the last thing that he had cared about, and she had been taken from him, and he couldn't even figure out why. The lesson continued to explain how he could turn a stick into a deadly weapon, that he could use either for hunting, or for self defense. The lessons continued like this until they had explained every possible way to survive when left alone in the wilderness. Accepting this fire hose of information that the midget had assured him was entirely necessary, left him with little question as to why he would need to be surviving like this in order to find whoever had done such a heinous thing. By the time the video turned off, hours had passed, and Cormac was so hungry and tired that he could think of nothing more than getting some food, and sleeping through the night.

This training continued like this for several weeks, so far as Cormac could tell, with no signs of slowing down or stopping. It was at the end of one of his rare review days that he had had the energy to ask the small man if he had any information about his mother's case. He was starting to get kind of agitated that they hadn't been able to do anything about it yet, but had consoled himself with the assurance that the police were looking into it. All the Mr. Wilson was willing to tell him, was that he didn't need to worry about what the police were doing, because he would be ready to find out what happened to his mother soon. As they continued back to the room where he had been sleeping, he continued by asking how much longer the training was going to take. Which the small man pointedly ignored. The small man opened the door to his room, and when he went inside, he felt the familiar draw to his bed and the inexorable tug of sleep weighing on him. No longer possessing the energy to argue, Cormac laid down to sleep. The next day, he had all but forgotten about his concerns of the previous day and followed the small man to the training room, as usual.

Time had passed. The boy couldn't tell how much time had passed, but he was sure that time had indeed passed. He couldn't quite pick out how many days he had been in this facility, training until he was completely exhausted, and then sleeping until he was woken up to train again. The only way he could really tell that he had been there for a while was that he had begun sporting a rather magnificent beard on his usually clean shaven face. Cormac never really liked facial hair, it was too scratchy when it was starting to grow in, but he never had time to really think about it during the day, and by the time his training was done, he was far too tired to do anything about it. Lately, he couldn't quite remember why he had started this training in the first place, all he could really remember was that he absolutely had to keep going.

One day and several inches of beard later Cormac awoke to find that when he opened his eyes, he was greeted not with the pitch blackness that had become his every morning, but with a brightly lit room. The room, while it had been the one he had slept in every night for the entirety of his stay at the facility, seemed strange and foreign to him. He never really had a chance to look at it in the morning, being rushed out of it each morning by the small man, and by the time he entered the room in the evening, he was far too exhausted to even take a look around. He waited, sitting on the bed for several minutes, looking around the room. It almost felt like he was doing something that he wasn't supposed to be doing, this wasn't the room he was supposed to look at. The only room he was supposed to see was the training room, and the hallway leading to it. He expected that the midget would be in the room any minute, as he had every morning for as long as Cormac could easily remember.

After several more minutes of waiting, he began to wonder if the small man wasn't coming. His mind began to wander more freely than it had in... Well, in a very long time. Cormac couldn't really be sure how long it had been. He began to wonder why he was in this facility. He could remember, as he had for many days previously, that he really had a very good reason for being there, but he never really questioned why. Let's see. He was here for training, that much was obvious. But why? He looked around the room, thinking that it may contain some clue as to his reason for being here. His eyes fell on what looked like a white button-up shirt, with black slacks, and on top was a pair of plain black leather shoes. Tucked inside the shoes was a pair of thin black socks, and hanging on a chair nearby was a suit jacket, and a thin black tie. Seeing no other option, Cormac donned the slacks, the shirt, and the jacket. He put the socks and leather shoes on his feet, and finally reached for the tie. He stood up as he tied it around his neck, and reached for the door. Leaving this room seemed like the only logical option.

The white hallways looked the same as they always had. None of the rooms had any sign of anything inside of them, nor any writing on them. He followed the familiar path that would lead him to his training room, all the while looking behind him and around corners, looking for Mr. Wilson. As he had been the only person Cormac had talked to for a while, the boy had grown rather attached to him. Now that the small man was no longer leading him down the hallways, Cormac felt sad and kind of lonely. Upon reaching the training room, Cormac opened the door and went inside, expecting another training session, but was dimly surprised to find that instead of a table in the middle of the room, there was a sink and mirror. On the table beside the sink, there was a cat of shaving cream, a brush, a straight razor, and a towel. Cormac had never really questioned why part of his training had been personal grooming, but now he understood and picked up the shaving cream to lather it onto his prodigious beard. It took the boy half an hour or so to finish taming the forest of hair to reveal the smooth thin face that he had grown up with.

He looked into the mirror for what felt like hours as he realized that he hadn't so much as seen his face in... Well, he couldn't really remember what he looked like until now. Cormac used the towel to clean the shaving cream from his face, and turned off the water in the sink. He still hadn't heard anything that could be construed as a human walking or talking all day, and was now beginning to think that his tiny companion wasn't going to turn up. This didn't concern Cormac nearly as much as he realized that it should, but all he could really think of was how much he should probably get going. Because he had something that he needed to do. The reason he had started training, that was what he wanted to do. The boy walked out into the hallway he had traversed so many times, and began to walk down it. It was at this point that he realized that he really had no idea how to get out of here. He wandered the hallways, and when he passed his room, he almost considered walking in and taking a nap, but he was determined now to do... The thing that he needed to do.

He continued walking past his room, and into the great unknown. He had never turned right from his room, and had no idea what he would find here. He continued straight down the hallway until it turned right, then left. He began to grow expectant as the end of the next hallway, he could see a different kind of light from the one he had grown accustomed to, it seemed yellower, warmer. As he approached, he slowly realized that he recognized this light, it was... Sunlight! His heart began to race as he sprinted to the end of the hall and turned right, towards the light. He stopped. The hallway in front of him wasn't a hallway. The hallway that stretched before him looked more like a forest, the inside suddenly became the outside. He began walking forward again, his feet touching stone and dirt for the first time in as long as he could really remember. His eyes took a while to adjust to the sunlight as he finally stepped beyond the building that had become his life. He looked back and could see that the hallway was really just a set of walls propped up by two by fours, set up in the middle of the forest. The doors he had been walking past, could be seen from this side of the wall as well.

He turned back around to find a small dirt path leading off into the distance. Not really knowing what else to do, he followed it until he came upon a clearing. There was an area that had been cleared of trees, and filled with gravel. In the center of the clearing was an all terrain vehicle with a helmet on the seat. There was a cell phone, and military grade GPS unit, on the inside of the helmet there was a note:

   You're done. Congratulations.
