# Chapter 2: 

Cormac froze in the middle if his ransacked room. So far as he could tell, nothing in his room had
been taken, except that. His phone starts to vibrate in his pocket "10 minutes until work". Not
wanting to be late again, he is forced to leave. His foot is still aching on every step, but he
continues down stairs, and to his car.

He makes it to work just before 9 am, and limps past his boss's desk. Cormac makes an awkward nod
towards his boss as he passes, and heads off to his desk.
