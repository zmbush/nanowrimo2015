# The Plan

Cormac looked at Mr. Tripp, slight shock spreading across his face, as he slowly came to accept what the man had said. It was as he had feared, in order to take down the TSA as he was so sure that he needed to, he would have to kill his father. This was not going to be easy, and Cormac knew that. However he also knew that his mother's death had to be avenged or he would never be able to forgive himself. The boy had become so distracted that the next time he looked at the passenger seat, Mr. Tripp was gone. The boy figured that he must have just dropped the man off while thinking about his plot, and not really thought about it.

He would have to follow Mr. Wilson's instructions now and make his way back to Burlington and wait for the small man to be done with his mission. In that time he would need to continue to train himself, and learn as much as he could about the organization that he had now become a member of. One that would look past a brutal murder, cover it up, and replace the victim with an impostor, for what? Cormac could not be sure, but he was sure that there must be some sinister reason behind it. He could come up with no sane reason why his mother's death would've been covered up, so their motives must be too terrible to consider.

The boy dialed in the address of the first safe house he had visited back in San Francisco, and got back on the freeway to head back there. He would need to drop of the car at the safe house before he flew back to Albany to pick up his other car. He began heading towards the bay bridge to get back into the city, and heading the other way, he could still see the traffic heading out of the city, what he assumed was the evening commute. The direction he was heading, however, was smooth sailing. Up ahead he saw signs mentioning a toll, and referring to a FasTrak lane. As he approached the toll plaza, he realized that he didn't have any change on him, so he wouldn't be able to pay the toll. He could see the people in the lanes next to him going through the toll plaza without stopping. Cormac figured that they must know something he didn't so he followed after them. He couldn't shake the feeling that someone would start following him after he went through the gateway, but no one did. The only thing he heard was a small beep from a device on the dashboard, which he only just now noticed.

The drive back to the safe house was otherwise uneventful, traffic was almost always heading in the opposite direction, but nobody really seemed to be going the same direction that he was. By the time he reached the safe house it was completely dark outside, and he almost missed the metal door as he drove down the small alleyway between buildings. With his car parked inside, he headed into the safe house proper in order to place an order for his returning flight back to Albany. Unfortunately for Cormac, once he had activated the mainframe and started to look for flights, it became apparent that since it was so late in the day, there was no way he was going to be able to get a flight until the following day.

It wasn't until he realized that he had ten hours to kill until his flight that it finally dawned on him that he hadn't slept since the parking lot back in Albany, and a wave of exhaustion broke over him. With nothing better to do, he walked over to the bed in the corner and laid down on the bed. He stared up at the featureless ceiling for what felt like several hours before he was able to actually shut down his brain enough to fall asleep. Thoughts of what Mr. Tripp, and Mr. Wilson had told him were cycling through his head, and he couldn't help trying to figure out what his next course of action should be.

The following morning, Cormac was woken up by a thin ray of light from the open window high above him shining directly into his face. He sat up, rubbing his eyes and looking around blearily for a clock. He grabbed his phone out of his pants that he had folded and laid on a chair, and saw that he only had 2 hours to get to his flight. He bolted upright, and began dressing in a hurry. His pants, tighter than what he had historically been used to, were a bit difficult to get on in the hurry and he found himself hopping on one foot trying to get the rest of his clothing on. Once dressed, he grabbed all of his remaining things and bolted out of the door. He was out on the street with the metal door scraping closed behind him in under ten minutes. He looked one way, and then the other. He thought he recognized one of them so he started running that way.

Once out on the street, he was even more sure that he had been down this street before. He turned towards where he believed the BART station would be, and was encouraged to see the large government building he had passed earlier. He was so focused on trying to identify his surroundings that he almost ran headlong into a pretty blond woman walking down the street. He did a kind of awkward half twirl to avoid her and kept running. Somewhere in the back of his head, he thought that the woman had looked familiar, but his need to catch his flight was overriding any other meaningful thoughts.

He made it into the BART station, bought his ticket and ran downstairs just in time to see the doors of a SFO Airport train with its doors wide open. He sprinted forward and made it in just as the doors closed behind him. He was happy to see that there was an open seat near the back of the train, so he sat down and relaxed slightly. He would just have to hope that this train made it on time, but, as his phone told him, he still had an hour and a half before his flight left, so he would most likely be fine.

After a few minutes in the train, sitting alone on a two person bench, he felt someone sit down next to him. He didn't much care who it was, and he continued to look out the window at the passing rows of strange looking houses. A few minutes later still, he heard a voice from the person behind him. "You aren't really going to attempt to kill your father, right?" Cormac turned in his seat, and looked over at the person sitting next to him. He was shocked, but somewhere deep inside, he had expected that the person seated next to him would be the pretty blond woman he had seen back at the Albany airport. Apparently she had been following him and listening to his conversations. "I don't know what you are talking about", Cormac replied, lying almost believably, "I think you have me mistaken with someone else".

"I am sure I don't, Mr. Anderson. I Assure you that I am fully aware of who you are. It's my job to make sure we keep an eye on all new agents", she held out her hand, which Cormac refused. "You may call me Miss Nettheit", she said finally. "Anyway, like I was saying, you aren't really planning on killing the leaders of the TSA. Mr. Greene has a family, you know. And Faust, well, he would be a handful to anyone who tried to cross him. And I don't even have to explain your father to you. Do you see? There is no way for you to succeed in your goal". Cormac just stared at her. How could she have known what he was planning, or what he had said in the car to Mr. Tripp.

"I know that you think you have discovered something incriminating, something that reveals how corrupt TSA is. In fact, almost every new agent finds something like that. We hire people with strong moral compasses, and many of them are not afraid to speak up if they see something wrong. Unfortunately, unless they begin to see the full picture, and accept that a certain amount of untruth is necessary, they quickly find themselves in over their heads. I wouldn't want that to happen to you. We are all so excited to see how you do, being The Condor's son comes with certain... Expectations." She finally finished her explanation and looked at Cormac with a look that was part concerned mother, part scolding teacher. The look on her face was as if she was trying to say, "I know you won't do anything stupid now".

She held out her hand again, but withdrew it before Cormac could react. He heard over the speakers "SFO Airport Stop. All passengers heading to San Francisco International Airport should off board here". There was a sudden bustle as a large number of people started to disembark. He could hear the woman call out over the sound of the crowd "I hope our little talk was helpful" before she disappeared into the throng of people heading into the airport. Cormac followed them trying to catch up to the woman, but was unsuccessful. He could no longer see her, and, as he checked his phone, he realized that he had no time to search for her again.

When the boy entered the airport he immediately started searching for the place where he would pick up his ticket. He quickly found it, and, as with the Albany Airport, he used the VIP line and spoke with the person behind the counter. She immediately recognized his name and handed him his ticket. He would only have 45 minutes to make it through security and onto his flight so he would be cutting it close she informed him. He thanked her and headed off towards his flight. He dodged through many people milling around the inside of the building. Since he had no carry on and no luggage, it should make it faster for him to get through security. The checkpoint was packed today, and Cormac stood anxiously as 40 minutes turned into 15 minutes before he reached the beginning of his line. He made it through the checkpoint with no incident and ran to his gate.

He listened carefully for the intercom for information about his flight and heard, as he ran that they were now boarding. He was still several gates away, but he was now sure he was going to make it. He breathed a heavy sigh of relief through his running when he finally saw the kiosk ahead of him. He barreled in towards the steward, and stood there panting and holding out his ticket for the man to take from him. The man in front of him gestured for him to enter the door behind him. He had made it.

This was only the second time that Cormac had been in a plane he realized, and yet it seemed almost familiar. The long tunnel he walked through was so similar to the one he had walked out of that morning. He finally arrived at the door to the plane and made his way inside. He found his seat, which was thankfully next to a window again, and he sat down. The boy sat in his seat waiting as a steady stream of people filtered into the plane, taking their seats and filling the plane to almost capacity. He heard the pilot come over the intercom to describe the weather conditions for their flight east, and inform people that they should fasten their seatbelts, which Cormac did. He leaned back in his chair and relaxed as the plane started moving slowly down the runway, eventually picking up speed until the behemoth machine lifted off of the ground and into the air.
