# An All Access Pass

Joy filled Cormac as he saw countless communications between the small man, Ms. Wilkinson, and Mr. Greene. He could see messages back and forth about many things, about other agents, about various forms of chemical warfare. Even a few conversations about a very confidential new truth serum called Verum Novum. He immediately returned to the mainframe to see if any more information was declassified by having access to the cypher of a higher up officer. When he looked up the personnel files for Ms. Wilkinson, he found that there was a wealth of information about her that he had been unable to access before.

He could see how long she had been working for the company, her speciality, the location of her office, and perhaps most importantly, her schedule. He could see that she was going to be in her office at headquarters for the remainder of the evening, room 1926. Also on the page, he could see a picture of her face. He was sure that he had never seen the woman before, as she was so high up in the organization, but her face looked so familiar. His eyes also landed on her speciality, apparently when she had been an agent, she specialized in mental manipulation. From what he could read, she could make you think whatever she wanted, so long as she was given enough time. It was clear to Cormac why this woman was known as "Die Faust". It was also clear to Cormac why she needed to be killed. Someone this manipulative surely must have had something to do with his mother's death.

For Mr. Greene, he found a similar level of information. He was just an average accountant, but he was the head of all of the accounting for the entire organization. His schedule was less explicit that Ms. Wilkinson, but he was fairly certain that he was either in his office in room 1934, or he was down in the office of records at 1226. It would be easier for Cormac to infiltrate the lower floors. There was less security there, and many agents were allowed to roam more freely. There were several locked doors between the main area of the floor and the filing room, but Cormac was sure he would be able to get through somehow. The room was where official hard copy files about all of the agents and the upper management were kept, but from what he had seen from his previous visits to headquarters, it would not be difficult to sneak in after someone.

If he wasn't able to find Mr. Greene in the lower levels, he would surely have to head up to level 19, where security was much tighter. It had been easier before for him to reach level 19 to find his father, but he couldn't be sure to get up there so easily this time. He was fairly certain that Mr. Wilson had warned them that he was coming. The traitor. He had told the boy that he would help him find his mother's killer, and he was turning his back on him in order to protect his corrupt bosses. Despicable.

The boy could see a plan coming together. He already knew where his father's office was, and besides, he wanted to deal with his father last. Cormac had always been the last priority to him, so why should he be any different to his son. Holden would get what's coming to him, but Cormac had to make sure that the job was done right. He would need to make sure he dealt with the other two first. They were the heart of this organization and he would need to follow through on destroying them if there was ever to be justice for his mother's death.

He would need to be very discrete if he was going to have any chance of getting near his trio of targets. Most of the agents weren't allowed near them as they were considered too valuable to let many people near. Cormac hoped that his status as the son of "The Condor" would allow him to get close without arousing suspicion. It was his only chance of completing his task. It was pitch black out by the time he had finished concocting his plan, and prepared to head out. He crawled underneath the bed in the safe house. There he had stashed several clubs, knives, and other weapons that he had stashed there during his time there. He would need all the tools he could find in order to pull this off.

A couple of the knives had even been fashioned to be able to be smuggled past metal detectors. Most agents were not allowed to bring weapons into headquarters, with good reason. Cormac had heard from Mr. Wilson that once a long time ago, one of the agents had managed to bring in a knife he had fashioned out of a railroad spike, and had brought it all the way up to the upper management's office. They had managed to stab at least three members of upper management before they were taken away and taken to be re-trained. The training often took several months during which time nobody heard from or saw the agent. Once he returned, there was nary a ghost of his previous violent insurrection.

The boy couldn't help but say that this mysterious agent had become a bit of an inspiration to him, and he had mirrored his techniques when he was crafting his weapons out of materials that even the most sensitive metal detector couldn't detect. If they were going to eventually take him away to be re-trained, he needed to make sure that he could at least complete his task before they did. He owed it to his mother to make sure that her death was not meaningless. He owed it to her to make sure that he got revenge for the people that caused her death and then proceeded to try to cover it up.

He strapped the makeshift weapons to his back and headed out to his car. It would be a long drive, but it was going to be worth it when he finally had vengeance for what had been done to his mother. He drove into the night, time was passing more slowly than it usually did, but he was so focused on the drive that he hardly noticed. He stopped very little on his trip, and by the time he made it to headquarters, it was after six. He was hopeful that the people he wanted to find would still be in the office. He was not suer that this would be the case but he had hope.

As he drove into the parking lot of the office building that housed TSA, he saw that there were still a few cars in the parking lot. In his experience, the higher ups would stay around the office for a long time after most of the other workers left. He was fairly certain that he would be able to make his way into the building without anyone noticing. The entrance to the elevator was hidden as usual, but the process to get in hadn't changed in many years, so Cormac entered into the building in the way that he had before the building. His ascent into the offices was slow. Slower than he was used to. It seemed to drag on for hours as he saw the numbers slowly climbing from B all the way up to 18.

When the doors to floor 18 finally opened, Cormac could see that it had been several hours since anyone had walked those halls. The lights were motion sensitive to save money and the money that they saved was money. The hallway before the boy was completely dark, and as he walked out into the hallway, the lights slowly flickered on. He walked down the hallway, and the lights continued to turn on. He was looking for Mr. Greene's office. It would be somewhere around here. He walked for a while searching the door numbers, finding the offices of many high level agents, but not finding the office of Mr. Greene.

He finally found the office and saw that on the door was the name of Mr. Greene, "Mr. Greene". Cormac listened at the door to try to determine if Mr. Greene was in his office or was elsewhere. He heard no sound, so he opened the door slowly. He could see the office of a man that was obsessed with order. The walls, those that weren't covered with books, were covered with filing cabinets. Inside of these cabinets were the files of every agent in the company. Each drawer was labeled with a range of letters. He was certain that each file contained a list of financial issues that had arisen as a result of each agent.

Every discretionary transaction that any agent used was passed through Mr. Greene. If someone had killed his mother, it was possible that there would be some information in the discretionary file about his mother. He had no idea where to start, so he just grabbed a file from a drawer. He had almost forgotten that he was wanting to see Mr. Greene, but at this point he was glad that he was not there. He would look through the file sot see if he could find anyone that had anything to do with his mother's death. He would find information on this event if it killed him.

He looked through file after file. They must have been files of agents that had been discharged, because all of the ones he pulled out described various mental illnesses, and incidental damage to the company and its property that the agent had caused. All of the files he looked through had no useful information that could be used to find information about the death of his mother that he was looking to find information about. After several minutes of searching through files, he stopped. His ears pricked up as he heard a sound from the hallway. He was certain that it was Mr. Greene, returning to his office.

In the split second from when the door handle turned to when Mr. Greene entered the room, Cormac did the only thing he could think of. He sprinted behind the man's desk and hid beneath it. He could hear the door creak and the slight footsteps of a man that found too much comfort in the embrace of a pint of ice cream. The heavy thuds of his footsteps moved towards him, and he could hear the sound of something dragging behind him. The footsteps suddenly stopped, and he heard the sound of a drawer from the filing cabinet being slammed shut. He cursed himself as he realized that he had left the drawer open.

The boy slowly pulled his plastic shiv out of his back pocket as he prepared for the man to sit down in front of him. His heart was beating and he was so focused that he felt like he could hear everything that was going on around him. The heavy footsteps started up again, and Cormac steadied himself beneath the man's desk. He looked forward, expecting to see the office chair slide forward at any second, but he only heard the sound of the heavy man's feet slowly fade until he heard the door to the room slam. He did not hear the foot falls again after that.

After waiting for several minutes to be sure that the man was not returning, he pulled himself up from behind the table, and looked around the office. Nothing was changed or moved as far as he could tell, but he was starting to think that he probably shouldn't hang around in this room for much longer. He looked around the room one last time to see if he could find anything of much use. His eyes fell on a brown suit jacket that was hanging from a hook on the wall. The boy thought that it must be the suit jacket that Mr. Greene wore, and that his visage would be disguised by such a ruse. He grabbed the jacket from the hook and put it on. It was a bit big for him, but it mostly fit okay.

Cormac returned to the hallway to look for Mr. Greene. His office had been a dead end, but he was determined to find the man and make sure that he couldn't stand by and ignore corruption again. He would make sure that the man would meet the same fate as his mother. The same fate that was so thoroughly ignored by the organisation. His heart was pounding in his throat as he walked through the hallway. He was glad that he was there so late at night because there were very few people in the halls.

When he heard someone say "Good Evening, Stephen", he relaxed slightly. Perhaps his ruse was working better than he had expected. He wasn't sure how the man walked, but he tried not to betray his concern and nervousness as he walked through the hallways. He continued down the hallway towards what he was sure was where the archive where they kept the old documents on the agents. During the day, he would not be able to access that room. In fact, none of his fellow agents were allowed in. But now, at this time of night, he was hopeful that the security of that room would be more relaxed.

At least, he hoped, he would be able to spot Mr. Greene and not be noticed. He would need to get the man to a discrete location before he fixed the problem. Although, Cormac considered, at this time of night, it might just be easier to sneak up behind the man and leave him in the middle of a room. Nobody would be able to pin it on him, of that he was sure. After all, he was wearing Mr. Greene's coat.

He walked down hallway after hallway, occasionally ducking into the random office that he was near when he saw the light from a security guard pass by. When their lights passed, he would duck back out and continue on his path. He was fairly certain that the records room was on this floor, but he wasn't sure where it was. He had only heard about it in passing from other agents, and from Mr. Wilson. His journey continued for longer than he would have liked. He found that most of the offices on this floor were decorated very similarly. Every room he entered had a desk in the middle with a rolling chair behind it. There were always one or more book cases, and one or more filing cabinet.

Eventually, the boy found a hallway that looked different from the others. This one was much narrower. It also did not appear to have offices on either side. The doors that were on the walls did not have windows and did not have the names of agents on them. Most of them had cryptic things on them like "Restricted Area" and "Medical Supplies". At the end of the hallway, Cormac could see a single door, and unlike the rest of the doors in the hallway, this one was slightly ajar. As he approached he could slowly make out the words on the door. He could see that the door was labeled "Records", and he could also see a light inside the room.

He crept forward, prepared to run away at any moment. The light from inside the room was frequently interrupted by the shadow of what he could only assume was Mr. Greene moving about inside. His heart was beating hard in his chest as he finally reached the door. He strained his ears, but all he could hear was the sounds of shuffling papers, and the occasional footsteps. He brought his face close to the crack in the door and looked at what he could see of the room. It was large. There were rows after rows of banker boxes with writing on them. Similar to the filing cabinets in Mr. Greene's office, each box had the name of an agent written upon it. Some of the boxes seemed quite old, as if they hadn't been touched in many years, and had just been left there to collect dust.

From his vantage point, he could not see anyone inside the room, but he guessed that if he opened the door quietly enough that he would be able to sneak inside the room without being seen. He would hide behind the rows of boxes, and from there he would be able to get a good view of what was going on inside the room, without running the risk of getting caught. After waiting several moments for any thing about the situation to change, he pulled gently on the door. Thankfully, there was no creak or sound, and the hinges slid silently. He squeezed himself into the room once he had made an opening big enough, and he ducked behind the nearest row of boxes.

The room was bigger than he could see from out side. The shelves went up into the semi-darkness. The light that he had seen was emanating from the center of the room and it didn't quite reach the farthest reaches of this cavernous repository of information. He could hear the rustling of papers and as he poked his head above one row of boxes, he could finally see to where the light was coming from. It appeared to be several rows forward, and on the other side of the room. He couldn't see from his point of view who it was that was holding the light, but he was going to figure it out.

He moved forward, taking care to not make the slightest sound as he slid forward from one row to the next. He moved diagonally, first to the left, then the right, always hiding behind the next row for a few moments to make sure that the light bearer was not roused. Once he was sure that he had not been discovered he continued to the next row. As he neared the source of the light, he was soon able to see who it was that shared the space with him. It appeared to be a man, wearing a brown suit not dissimilar to the one that Cormac was wearing. He had brown hair and he was about six feet tall. He was hunched over a box with its lid laying on the ground, and papers from inside piled around him.
