# An All Access Pass

Joy filled Cormac as he saw countless communications between the small man, Ms. Wilkinson, and Mr. Greene. He could see messages back and forth about many things, about other agents, about various forms of chemical warfare. Even a few conversations about a very confidential new truth serum called Verum Novum. He immediately returned to the mainframe to see if any more information was declassified by having access to the cypher of a higher up officer. When he looked up the personnel files for Ms. Wilkinson, he found that there was a wealth of information about her that he had been unable to access before.

He could see how long she had been working for the company, her speciality, the location of her office, and perhaps most importantly, her schedule. He could see that she was going to be in her office at headquarters for the remainder of the evening, room 1926. Also on the page, he could see a picture of her face. He was sure that he had never seen the woman before, as she was so high up in the organization, but her face looked so familiar. His eyes also landed on her speciality, apparently when she had been an agent, she specialized in mental manipulation. From what he could read, she could make you think whatever she wanted, so long as she was given enough time. It was clear to Cormac why this woman was known as "Die Faust". It was also clear to Cormac why she needed to be killed. Someone this manipulative surely must have had something to do with his mother's death.

For Mr. Greene, he found a similar level of information. He was just an average accountant, but he was the head of all of the accounting for the entire organization. His schedule was less explicit that Ms. Wilkinson, but he was fairly certain that he was either in his office in room 1934, or he was down in the office of records at 1226. It would be easier for Cormac to infiltrate the lower floors. There was less security there, and many agents were allowed to roam more freely. There were several locked doors between the main area of the floor and the filing room, but Cormac was sure he would be able to get through somehow. The room was where official hard copy files about all of the agents and the upper management were kept, but from what he had seen from his previous visits to headquarters, it would not be difficult to sneak in after someone.

If he wasn't able to find Mr. Greene in the lower levels, he would surely have to head up to level 19, where security was much tighter. It had been easier before for him to reach level 19 to find his father, but he couldn't be sure to get up there so easily this time. He was fairly certain that Mr. Wilson had warned them that he was coming. The traitor. He had told the boy that he would help him find his mother's killer, and he was turning his back on him in order to protect his corrupt bosses. Despicable.

The boy could see a plan coming together. He already knew where his father's office was, and besides, he wanted to deal with his father last. Cormac had always been the last priority to him, so why should he be any different to his son. Holden would get what's coming to him, but Cormac had to make sure that the job was done right. He would need to make sure he dealt with the other two first. They were the heart of this organization and he would need to follow through on destroying them if there was ever to be justice for his mother's death.

He would need to be very discrete if he was going to have any chance of getting near his trio of targets. Most of the agents weren't allowed near them as they were considered too valuable to let many people near. Cormac hoped that his status as the son of "The Condor" would allow him to get close without arousing suspicion. It was his only chance of completing his task. It was pitch black out by the time he had finished concocting his plan, and prepared to head out. He crawled underneath the bed in the safe house. There he had stashed several clubs, knives, and other weapons that he had stashed there during his time there. He would need all the tools he could find in order to pull this off.

A couple of the knives had even been fashioned to be able to be smuggled past metal detectors. Most agents were not allowed to bring weapons into headquarters, with good reason. Cormac had heard from Mr. Wilson that once a long time ago, one of the agents had managed to bring in a knife he had fashioned out of a railroad spike, and had brought it all the way up to the upper management's office. They had managed to stab at least three members of upper management before they were taken away and taken to be re-trained. The training often took several months during which time nobody heard from or saw the agent. Once he returned, there was nary a ghost of his previous violent insurrection.

The boy couldn't help but say that this mysterious agent had become a bit of an inspiration to him, and he had mirrored his techniques when he was crafting his weapons out of materials that even the most sensitive metal detector couldn't detect. If they were going to eventually take him away to be re-trained, he needed to make sure that he could at least complete his task before they did. He owed it to his mother to make sure that her death was not meaningless. He owed it to her to make sure that he got revenge for the people that caused her death and then proceeded to try to cover it up.

He strapped the makeshift weapons to his back and headed out to his car. It would be a long drive, but it was going to be worth it when he finally had vengeance for what had been done to his mother.
