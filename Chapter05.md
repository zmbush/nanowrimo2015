# Burning Curiosity

The next morning was rather uneventful. He woke up with his alarm, and made it to work at the usual time. He spent most of the morning trying to identify the key online, while switching back to data entry any time someone looked his way. He managed to identify it as the key to a display cabinet. The same kind that was in his father's study.

"Why would he need to so thoroughly hide the key to his display cabinet?" thought Cormac. He couldn't think of any reason why it would need to be hidden unless there was something more important than his generic trophies. Thoughts of what could be hidden in his father's study filled his thoughts for the rest of the day.

After foraging for another lunch, he finishes the remainder of his workday and heads home. When he arrives back in his house, he heads straight for his father's study without even saying hello to his mother. He takes the key out and unlocks the cabinet. The hinges creak as he pulls the door open. With the door open, he sees no difference in the items displayed on the shelves.

He picks up one of the trophies and examines it. It looks like what he would expect, plastic, stone, generic engraving. He continues to pull out everything from the cabinet one by one to examine and finds nothing. When goes to pull out the largest of the trophies it leans forward on a previously invisible hinge.

The carpet in the center of the room is pulled down through the floor, and the floor boards sink to form a spiral staircase down to who knows what. Cormac heads down the staircase. It is a tight fit, and leaves very little headroom, but he is able to squeeze down it. As the room above him becomes obscured by the very stairs he walks down, he hears them slide back up to presumably return the floor to its pristine state.

He walks down for what seems like hours, as he fully begins to realize why he and his mother were never allowed into his father's study. As he reached the bottom of the stairs, the narrow hallway opened up into a rather large open room. The walls and floors were concrete. There were tables lined up next to the walls, and there were several large monitors mounted against the back wall.

Unlike the room above, this one did not share the layers of dust. It seemed, in fact, to be striving for a level of cleanliness to rival the most stringent operating room. The slight scent of bleach filled the air, and it was so cold that Cormac had a hard time even breathing in.

He looked back towards the staircase he had just walked down to find nothing but a smooth cement wall with nothing but a thin crack to betray the passageway behind. Cormac's heart began to race as his eyes darted around the room. The stainless steel tables bereft of any sign of use, the huge screens taking up nearly all of his field of view, and the oppressive air in the place combined and the sense of panic started to well up in the pit of his stomach.

The sound of the room pressed in like someone was crushing his head with a pair of pillows, the hum of no sound at all was deafening. He strained to hear any sound at all but only heard the sound of his own heavy breathing. When the tiny computer console in the corner of the room started whirring and making tiny beeping noises, his acutely straining ears turned it into a jet plane taking off.

His attention was drawn entirely towards the screen above the console that flickered to life. The screen was completely black save for the sentence `console login:` in bright white font. A white box pulsed rhythmically next to the colon beckoning Cormac forward. He sat down in front of the screen and stared at it. The keyboard clicked loudly as he pressed the keys, the din filled the room for a brief moment as he typed `test` and pressed enter. The computer in front of him responded with a simple `Password:` prompt, and again the room filled with sound as he began typing only to discover that nothing was showing up. Confused, he pressed enter again. The computer sat there for several moments until it responded with `Login incorrect`, and continued again with `console login:`.

Nonplussed, Cormac sat in the chair staring at the screen where that interaction had just taken place. Clearly, he decided, it must be some sort of authentication screen, but for what he had no idea. He stood up and walked around the room. Several minutes pass with only the sound of the computer's fan whirring, and his footsteps filling the room. His eyes began scanning the walls of the room, searching for any more cracks in the walls that would betray some kind of secret panel or door. With his face almost touching the cold surface, he was able to pick out the slight outline of the doorway.

He began to study the next wall with renewed interest, and again found that there were visible lines in the concrete. This time the lines seemed to start and end along the edges of the stainless steel table, but there was no other visible blemishes on the smooth stone surface. The sound of his footsteps continued to fill the empty space as he moved towards the back wall. This wall had no visible lines in it, other than the space that was cut away to allow the screens to sit flush with the rest of the surface. He passed the console on his way to the next wall, and found a set of lines similar to those found on the opposite wall.

With the results of his search largely fruitless, Cormac's panic began to rise again. He walked back towards the doorway from which he entered, and though he pushed as hard as he could muster, he was unable to move the door at all. He started pounding on the door desperately, but was met only with a cold sting of his hands being smashed against a solid surface. "MOM!!!" came a desperate cry as he continued to bang against the door, but the sound only echoed around the chamber. His body began to shake as he slumped down to the ground.

He sat for what felt like days as his brain went into overdrive imagining his mother's reaction as she is unable to find her son. Would she figure out how to open the staircase? Would she call the police? He reaches into his pocket to find his cell phone. Perhaps he has some signal down underneath all of this concrete? The screen blinks to life, only to greet him with the unwelcome but expected "No Service" message.

He gripped his phone tightly as his desire to smash it on the ground grew. He stifled the urge to scream out in frustration, and instead let out a strange guttural groan. He pushed himself upwards with his back still flat against the unforgiving wall, and calmed himself down enough to put the phone back in his pocket. He began again smashing his fists against the cold stone and called out again and again until he could barely speak. His hands were bruised, and his body was growing weak, but he finally accepted that he was making no progress and turned his attention to the only thing in the room that he was able to interact with: the console.

He sat back down in the chair, and stared anew at the screen. The record of his previous attempt was staring him in the face. He guessed that the "login" was referring to a user name of some sort, so he began to enter his father's name. He pressed enter, and was greeted with the same `Password:` prompt. He tried typing in his mother's name, and pressed enter. `Login incorrect`. Not surprised, he tried another combination. His father's name and his name. Nothing. His last name, and their dog's name. Nothing. He continued trying user name and password combinations until the computer froze.

Cormac screamed, smashed his hand down on the table, and threw the keyboard sideways. He stood up so violently, that the chair slid out from under him and rolled across the floor. He began running his finger through his hair and pacing the room. He tried to pick up one of the tables only to find that it was bolted to the ground. He sprinted towards the space where a door once stood and smashed against it with his whole body. He fell to the ground, and stared up at the ceiling. "I'm going to die here" was all he could think. "I'm going to die here, and my mother is never going to find the body". "I'm going to go missing just like my father, and then she'll be all alone".

He laid on the floor until all of the adrenaline in his body was gone. He laid on the floor until his mind was nothing but the empty drone of "I'm going to die here". He laid on the floor until his heart rate dropped, his mind calmed. Until he no longer had the energy to panic.
